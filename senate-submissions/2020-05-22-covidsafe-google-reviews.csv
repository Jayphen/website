Sam Stainsby,19 May 2020,54,The app seems to be working OK, but with a heavy drain on the battery. The source code has been published once, but is not being updated with subsequent releases. That's simply not good enough! Feedback from the technical community about vulnerabilities and other bugs is being largely ignored. For n,
Naomi T,21 May 2020,9,You have to play around with the phone settings a lot to make this app function properly, done this many times but it doesn't work most of the time. This would be a nightmare to set up for anyone that isn't tech savvy.,
Ben Woodford,19 May 2020,121,This app causes MAJOR connectivity issues between my device and Bluetooth audio devices, such as headphones or speakers.

Iain Hunter,21 May 2020,2,The concept is a good idea in theory. I only turn my wifi on when I leave home so I have not experienced any battery issues with my Galaxy S10 5G device.

Francisco Piragibe,7 May 2020,64,The use of Bluetooth is disruptive in this version: if you're listening to music using a Bluetooth speaker, for instance, there's a 2 to 5 seconds pause every 30 seconds or so, or, it seems, every time you're in contact with someone using the same app. Very annoying! However, it's understandable for,

Blue Gum,20 May 2020,1,The app is causing a much faster battery drain on my Samsung A70. It also causes my Bluetooth speaker to constantly drop connections for 30 seconds.

Joanna James,27 April 2020,165,I thought this app would use a lot of battery due to Bluetooth, but it uses only 1% per hour, which is very reasonable.

Nic Roberto,5 May 2020,253,Most of The reviews here seem to be missing the point.

Tony Eckert,29 April 2020,42,My first impression is very positive.

Bill Donald,26 April 2020,31,Average implementation. You can't find it by searching for it by the correct name in the app store! You have to insert a space. The name field should not be one.

Steve,4 May 2020,72,No problem with installion on Android 9. However I strongly object to the alert message "COVIDSafe is scanning to keep you safe."

Greg W,27 April 2020,96,Great initiative. Just a note to those that don't understand how this works. This app is based on proximity. It does not track or know your location. All it knows is if you've come close to someone with COVID-19. Imagine walking blindly around town but having to raise a flag if you encounter someone,
Lincoln Crawley,27 April 2020,32,I'm sure it's a great app but I cannot complete the registration process.

Adam Cheng,5 May 2020,23,Nice and simple app. reminds you when you forget to turn on Bluetooth, which is good.

Please fix this app to be more effective if it turns off afte,
Keith Miller,17 May 2020,81,A great concept but it needs all of us to use it to help keep us all safe. Note oppo users will need to lock the app so the phone doesn't close it down.

Kevin Coleman,27 April 2020,5,I support this app fully but some constructive criticism. The send data is confusing everyone, also using the international number structure should be removed as many are clearly entering the leading zero causing rejection (it is only for Australia)! Battery usage is also compromised with bluetooth,
Noel Lewis,27 April 2020,19,I tried to install the app via my mobile phone. I got to the part where it asked for my mobile phone number and got the +61 and the 0 usually used for local numbers and failed. It then asked me to geta pin number and I had to back out of the installation to get the number. Then I could not get back,
Filbert Sim,13 May 2020,9,For those with Oppo phones, if you keep getting the battery optimisation notification, try this. Click settings - battery - and turn off "smart power saver". Also, click "custom power saver" - scroll down to the "COVIDSafe" app and click it and then click "allow background running". Hope this helps,
Michael O'Keefe,7 May 2020,8,Great app that will help us save lives and help the health officials decide on the restrictions.

Jason Hobart,27 April 2020,11,Phone battery runs down quicker with the bluetooth constantly scanning.

Julie Fehon,26 April 2020,25,Downloaded & installed without a hitch. The more people install the app, the quicker outbreaks are identified.

Lew Cody,27 April 2020,19,People use Siri, Alexa and Google Assistant without a second thought and have thrown their privacy out the window but an app that is going to help control the spread of Covid19 should be accepted and installed by everyone.

Van K. Nguyen Evers,26 April 2020,75,Easy to install and easy to use. All info are stored encrypted on phone. Great initiative! People should be less sensitive about giving this a go. Facebook and google track our every moves and yet everyone voluntarily give them a green light. Give this a chance to work! Not every app will be perfect,
Ian Bissett,27 April 2020,5,I was sceptical at first... However this app requests less private information than a social media or online shopping site. The premise is sound and the app appears to be very configurable and you get plenty of control over how your personal data is shared with the government. Looking forward to hea,

Gobsmacked at the people who are peeved with the icon or that they couldn't register prior to 6pm or that the FBI will get their data (despite them using every other social media platform), or that having B,
Ashleigh Grace,27 April 2020,2,Great app, easy to register for. Only downside is the persistent notification. This is quite annoying and very much not needed. Maybe instead of having a persistent notification, just send a notification when the app is no longer tracking, reminding the user to restart to app or restart their phone.,
Shaharin Yussof,27 April 2020,32,Installed on the first go because I installed it when it was ready to be installed. Great initiative. I hope enough people download and install it so it can do its job to reduce the spread. Too many detractors are worried about 1984 type surveillance. It's arleady too late for that, and too many big,
Kevin Holmes,29 April 2020,3,App was easy to install. Unfortunately since installing the app I have issues connecting to devices via Bluetooth. I'll give it a couple of days to see if there is an update to rectify this, if not then unfortunately I'll have to delete the app.,
Angela Whitehead,3 May 2020,6,All very simple and straightforward, no noticeable drain on my battery so far. However, having a permanent notification that the app is running which cannot be dismissed is very annoying, especially for those who like to keep their notifications to a mininum. Please rethink this feature team!,
Eduardo Klein,4 May 2020,1,It is a good app. My phone did not slow down its perfonmance. I will trust the goverment on this. If they fail us they will certainly pay. The app needs a "turn off" button as I don't need it running in the background when stayin at home.,
Ben MacCormack,10 May 2020,1,If there is a chance the app can save lives it's worth the bugs. Yes it compromises other Bluetooth connections and battery usage slightly increases, but both are preferable to death. And to those concerned about 'giving away' your location; you gave that away when you bought a mobile phone.,
Jonathan Handojo,8 May 2020,3,I actually like the idea behind this app, it's ingenious. However, can I have the notification to display all the time to know that it's actually working? If it disappears, I start to think that it's not working. I've also tried restarting my phone to, but still disappears... I'd say in no more than,
Dan Dempsey,14 May 2020,Buggy. (Motorola G 3rd Gen) Seems to work ok for 4 - 5 hours, but time is uncertain as phone rarely leaves my pocket. Then gives error message "Unfortunately bluetooth share has stopped" Phone is then locked and must be restarted to get any functionality. Bluetooth is active on restart. No other app,
Amanda Levick,20 May 2020,1,I know this is important so will keep it but it drains battery excessively. Almost to the point it's unusable. I've had to start carrying a portable charger when I'm out. I think I'm going to have to disable it when I'm at home. I can't carry a portable charger around the house. Ridiculous.,
Mark Grima,27 April 2020,5,Invalid phone number. With or without the 0 at the start "invalid phone number". It's been pretty valid for quite a number of years now. Meh, I tried...good luck getting your 40% Has been launched for about 24 hours now. üôÑ,
Col Walker,28 April 2020,3,I would score this higher however, my Wife, who has had the same phone number for 13 years, cannot download the app as her "phone number is not valid". Come on app designers, sort this out. You would get a much higher take up rate if everyone could access it!,
Amit Dubey,26 April 2020,16,This app access less of your information. Most of the Google app/Facebook/youtube/Twitter etc asked to get access to your contacts, camera , message , and many more. This covidsafe required only location track so it's one of the app that require less information from end user. Google and Facebook tr,
James Lee,27 April 2020,4,The app install and registration was very smooth for me, and as far as I can tell the app seems to be working fine with no obvious impact on battery life. Great to see the government get this out of the door so early compared to most other countries - I hope it gets used by enough people!,
Susan Lafferty,19 May 2020,4,I have tried 3 times to log in. Every time I try to see the code they sent, I lose the page and have to start again. Unless I can see the code without losing the page, I can't sign up. Now that I have downloaded it, it constantly turns off the battery permissions.,
Jasmin Tinjak,26 April 2020,35,Great concept to keep us safe. Signing up was easy and I don't feel like it's actually tracking me to the extent some of you make it. Just hooks up to other Bluetooth devices I've been near and informs if they do get infected. I'll do anything to help stop the spread and keep my family safe.,
Stephan S,26 April 2020,40,The App will not accept my phone number -in the prescribed format or otherwise-, no matter what I try. I have attempted to un- and re-install a number of times to no avail. I have had this mobile number for at least 15 years and it is my main current number. Should have been properly pre-release tes,
Frank Paterson,29 April 2020,4,On my 2 samsung S7 Edges, grey imports, flashed from Taiwanese to to Aus Telstra firmware and subsequently updated twice OTA, it works flawlessly. The only reservation I have is American mega giant Amazon holding the data in its cloud, even if the servers are in Aus. I don't trust USA big business a,
Harley Mc,2 May 2020,6,I have no idea why this app needs my blue tooth on when I am isolating at home with my immediate family. I certainly don't need notification after notification of the fact I've turned permissions off when at home. I've deleted it. I'll reinstall after the app can be turned on and off with one click.,
Jeffrey Min,4 May 2020,2,It keeps closing...not very useful when I get home and realise it hasn't been tracking. I make sure I reopen the app every morning but it closes within a couple hours. I have selected the not allowed option within battery optimisation, so it's not due to that.,
Shahram,11 May 2020,4,Running this app after a couple of days made the GMail app stop syncing. The permanent notification on the screen is really annoying as well. With staying at home practice, I wish I could turn it on and off as required. Also settings to hide the notification would be helpful.,
Steve S,17 May 2020,43,Great idea and service, execution not so good. My battery on a Samsung S10+ only lasts now to about 5pm (9 hrs) whereas it usually would last double that. I've installed the update today and will test again. /Update/ since updating to the newer release the battery is not badly affected. Increased to,
Craig Barwick,20 May 2020,2,Great idea, but doesn't work. Battery optimisation keeps reverting to incorrect setting, meaning the app isnt active... Have tried locking the app on my oppo r11s, and turning the Background Freeze and Abnormal Apps Optimisation off, but it still turns the battery optimisation on and shuts down the,
Farishta Nazari,26 April 2020,6,I give this app five star, because it helping of our health improve.but when I am not in a public places, I should have free choice to turn off my Bluetooth or location because this app designed for public places. so some people have an issue with their phone battery life I hope see those option for,
Travis Nisbet,27 April 2020,11,Can't get beyond the 'invalid phone number' message. I know my phone number is not invalid, yet it won't tell me what is wrong with my number or how I am entering it. I want to do the right thing, but the difficulty I am experiencing in trying to do this is quite dissuading.,
Sai Dhanankula,26 April 2020,307,Waiting for registration to be brought online (ABC says it's going to be online at 1800 today). I like the following already: > Very little identifying information is being requested. > Data is stored on my phone till I or my contacts become positive for covid19 AND > Once enough people download the,
VERLOCI-REAPER,27 April 2020,8,Installed and worked perfectly fine, sign up was a breeze and had no issues. I've read many reviews and there are a lot of concerns with mobile numbers not being valid so I hope that can get sorted for the few who get that issue, other than that the security depends on your privacy settings in your,
John Tolhurst,26 April 2020,35,1. Data lives on my phone, not in a remote database. 2. 3 week old data is removed. 3. If I contract the virus, health officials can quickly reach those I've been near. Like it a lot, it breaks ALL the rules of commercial apps. Well done Aussie medical advisors. Well focused app.,
Nelson Cheney,26 April 2020,48,So I downloaded this app cause I'm concerned about the ongoing pandemic. But a few issues. 1. Originally couldn't register to the app cause registering was not available 2. Even though the government says it won't track your current location, it still requires location permission, or else it doesn't,
Alexander Sharikov,28 April 2020,5,Super easy to use. No concerns on privacy, especially in comparison to Google and Facebook. A couple of suggestions: 1. support older Android device as elderly people don't have latest phones. 2. An option to disable the notification.,
Jim Smythe,28 April 2020,6,I've installed this app and so far haven't got Covid 19 (that I know of). Registration was easy, and can be done using a pseudonym. Battery usage is quite low. Ongoing notification to tell you that it is working, and will let you know if it stops working (eg. you turn off Bluetooth),
Chippy Miller,27 April 2020,8,Very frustrating... at first it was telling me that my mobile number is invalid, then I got to the pin. It accepted the pin the first time, then the second time said the pin was invalid. I have tried 5 times now... maybe I'll try for a 6th time, then forget it.,
joeyws89,27 April 2020,3,The app is only for case tracking purposes, and if it helps us get back to work quicker, the better. People who are concerned about privacy need not worry, data is encrypted, stopped locally and deleted after 21 days. There are so many other apps out there which are of more concern.,
Leigh Wardle,26 April 2020,73,Everyone Read This 3pm Sunday: Hi, Thank you for your report. While the COVIDSafe app is available for download, we have currently disabled the registration process. At this stage we recommend that you uninstall the app until the registration process is brought back online. We expect this to be late,
Mike Redman,27 April 2020,4,People need to help the system that supports them, consider they rely on the Government so payments. Relax and respect this application. Consider looking privacy settings of commonly use social platforms and realise what data you give away willingly to stay connected. Targeted ads are the tip of dig,
Gary Higgins,27 April 2020,1,Something's up... Entered my phone number as requested, but a PIN was never forthcoming, no matter how many times I attempted the last stage of registration, either in WiFi, or outside on Telstra. Is this a bug, or a feature??,
Mark Westcott,29 April 2020,6,Stops working after a couple of hours and rebooting is needed to get going again. Version 6.0.1 of Android. Err message flashes with description "Unfortunately, Bluetooth Share has stopped". In this state I couldn't even answer a call. Very little usefulness for my Motorola Moto G 3rd generation.,
Kristina Hayward,4 May 2020,1,So far easy enough. Downloaded and appears to be ok. Only know it's there as I have a message on my screen saying if that message disappears then I need to restart my phone. As long as I don't get spam or covid I'd give it a 5 star üòâ,
Glen Sim,8 May 2020,66,It drained my battery, whilst on, my phone does not last a day. Everyone should uninstall it from your phone, if you want your phone to last all day. I'd rather use my phone as it was intended to be used, to send & receive calls. I highly recommend that you either do not download, or uninstall the a,
Anne Gordon,27 April 2020,11,Update - Turned off wi fi, mobile number now accepted. Maybe this info could be on registration page.... Downloaded app ok on 27/4. Tried to register, but app won't accept my mobile number, tried with and without leading zero. Says the number is invalid. Can't go any further, no troubleshooting opti,
Emma Willis,26 April 2020,6,Quick and easy to navigate the set up. No issues. A great way to notify you of a suspected/confirmed case of the virus in a place where you have been. That way you know to isolate immediately. Great work to all involved to get this app up and running. I hope more people sign up to this quickly. Well,
Salman Syed Mohammed,27 April 2020,12,I have only installed them recently. My only doubt is that how effective this would be when there are people like myself who don't switch on Bluetooth unless your are driving. Perhaps question of less radiation emission or the fact that data collection through Bluetooth is in range limit of 10mtr mi,
Rob Burgess,26 April 2020,193,Very easy. All the media reports said registration would be from 6pm. I just installed it (5:50pm) and can confirm that it registered very easily. Put in my phone number and received a confirmation code by text immediately. All set up in less than a minute!,
declan ryan,27 April 2020,1,I can see this app being very useful eventually. However I cannot get past signing up as it tells me I have an invalid phone number, although I have entered in the correct phone number, hopefully this can be fixed soon...,
Lynda Lake,6 May 2020,1,I successfully registered the app on my Android phone but partners iphone rejects his details. Have uninstalled, switched off phone then reinstalled but still says problem with phone number even though it is entered correctly. Can't find any help on this topic. NB tried again next day and was succes,
Casey Poolman,27 April 2020,So far so good. Personally would like to choose when to have it running as it does use battery. I'm at home a lot and would only need to have my Bluetooth and the app running when I am out getting groceries and such.,
Stef C,26 April 2020,10,Works well from what I can tell but searching COVIDSafe instead of Covid safe leads to other country apps. Also had to spend time reading privacy policy as to why location services (listed at the bottom of the page)are required for Bluetooth to work... Independent policy report isn't linked in priva,
Simon Noble,28 April 2020,9,Easy to install, took under a minute, simple questions, you are asked permission again, if any of your data ever needs to be accessed. I plan to use it so we can all get back to normal movement again & then just delete it when this is over. Google, FB & Instagram contain far more personal informatio,
Brad Kirk,28 April 2020,9,Look it very simple. Install it. Allow it. if you have been in close contact with a confirmed case you will be contacted. It won't let let you know the person and you may not know them. Also you won't get informed if you just passed them. It works on Bluetooth, so on a 30min train with someone infec,
Melissa Kelly,27 April 2020,6,Can't even register and get past entering the unique 6 digit code. I open my messages to retrieve the 6 digit code (because it is not visible from the preview on my screen) and then when I re-open the app to complete registration, I have to start all over again!,
Harry Grantham,26 April 2020,7,Any amazing way to slow the spread of COVID-19. If you download this app, you are saving lives. This app uses bluetooth technology and not location tracking. If you are worried that the government is watching your location then turn off location services in settings for that app.,
Lowell Tischler,27 April 2020,6,If you have hesitation regarding the privacy aspect or your location being shared. Please I beg you read the privacy section in the app. The app only needs access to your Bluetooth. It does not need location services. I turned of location services and only got alerts that my Garnin app needed locati,
Michael Green,29 April 2020,5,I thought I had loaded it on 20th April but had some doubt if I'd done it properly as I had not been asked to enter personal info. I had opened a Google Chrome A/c to load this and thought it might use info from this as Google Maps records where I live (post code). On 21st as I fiddled with it and r,
Geoff Baird,29 April 2020,1,When registering, it seems you cannot use numbers in your pseudonym. It doesn't reject it, but gives an "invalid mobile number" on the next step. Seems to be no "help" information for registering.,
Jonathan Denton,1 May 2020,4,It keeps on shutting itself off after a few minutes. Could be because it's installed on an Oppo phone which has a manufacturer-customized version of Android, but the app's not really protecting anyone if it isn't running.,
David Hulmes,4 May 2020,3,Most important thing here is that it helps to keep us safe and allow things to start opening up - that's the top priority of this. Some feedback is that it's causing music and casting to stutter on a regular basis - concerned that some people might delete because of this.,
Geoff Chatfield,7 May 2020,11,I have the same problem as Ben Parker. My Android keeps turning off the battery optimization setting so the app disables itself after approximately five minutes. Therefore the app is useless to me. I have reinstalled it to no avail. I have an OPPO A73 with up to date software version 7.1.,
Max,11 May 2020,Many 1or 2 star reviews are describing a negative experience. I have a Samsung galaxy S8 (Android phone). The app is not intrusive. It has a tiny icon to let you know it's active (which displays upper left of my screen). Notifications are very minimal! Bluetooth battery usage is small. The governmen,
Tony1652,28 April 2020,2,For anyone still receiving an invalid phone number error message, try restarting your phone after downloading the App. This worked for me after a few frustrating minutes of trying to set it up. Don't forget to omit the zero when entering your mobile number.,
Andrew T,27 April 2020,1,Initially wouldn't allow my phone number, but when you turn off Wi-Fi it accepts it. Thanks to the other reviewers who wrote that, if only that was written during the process it would save everyone a lot of grief!,
Manish Kumar,5 May 2020,1,Installed but there is a constant notification on which can't be disabled - ideally it should run in the background. And no additional information unlike similar apps being used in other countries with detailed hotspot/transmission information visible on map, to avoid such place or area. Very basic.,
Wayne Harper,28 April 2020,13,If an app, which is govt sanctioned, written specifically for them likely by a respected and knowledgeable IT group who know their stuff & can't get something as SIMPLE as the mobile# verification process correct, how could it possibly be trusted? Uninstalled. It will take a LOT to convince me NOW t,
Mark T,27 April 2020,8,Simple app, easy to activate and could save lives. Those worried about privacy might consider all the other myriads of data their smartphone sends out without their knowledge. You effectively forfeited your privacy when you bought the phone! Here you have the chance to save lives and the data has ve,
Andrew Osborne,26 April 2020,3,This app looks very well thought out and the data collection is retained on your phone with a 21 day rolling deletion can only be shared with health officials by you. From a privacy standpoint, Google and Facebook will have far more of your private information than the Government will ever get from,
Brian Chen,27 April 2020,205,Great idea but not a huge fan of how it constantly pings with Bluetooth. A much better solution would have been to use geo location or geofencing for those of us who don't keep Bluetooth on all the time. Where as internet is something everyone always has on, whether mobile data or wifi. Also don't l,
Daniel Willetts,28 April 2020,2,Generally works just fine. Would like it if the notification saying its working wasn't there constantly. Also cant seem to get my phone to stay connected to my smart watch woth this app pinging the bluetooth all the time. Should be a simple fix for devs.,
Lone Wolf,27 April 2020,10,A lot of talk about privacy but if you use any social media apps no matter the security settings all the information is stored somewhere on a server, So unless you have none of these apps then argument over privacy is point less. Very fast to install and register not only to help others but also to,
Glenn Allan,27 April 2020,3,No issues installing, also helped my elderly mother install over the phone. Sign up was only hindered by having to scroll to complete some answers and the difficulty mum had with the PIN code. Have had no issues with battery life, minimal impact and haven't noticed any other issues.,
Francis Young,28 April 2020,32,Because I'd prefer a timely phone call if I've been exposed to Covid-19. And the app doesn't know me, my phone number, or my location. It only has a unique ID that a Health Dept staffer can use to alert me to get tested. A no brainer for everyone to install, so we can get this isolation lifted soone,
James N,28 April 2020,Doesn't go far enough. Technically basic system. Should log your gps on phone like google maps timeline feature to assist recalling your whereabouts. Other counties' apps won't permit you to go certain places without scanning qr code from your phone screen. It works there because the populations the,
Luke Glover,28 April 2020,6,Can confirm through the Android settings the app doesn't send anything to a central server unless you explicity allow it (Android reports 0 bytes sent over the network). And battery usage is reported as 0% even after the app has been running for 8 hours. Only complaint is the persistent notification,
Rick Williams,29 April 2020,2,

Anish Weerasooriya,29 April 2020,3,Weird hole in the App... There is no option on my device (S20 5G) to allow access to location information at all times. Even though the app primarily uses Bluetooth for positioning, what if the app is closed? I advise keeping the app running in the background just in case and adding it to your app w,
Simon Hallgath-Jolly,1 May 2020,3,A well designed app that only collects the minimal data required if you choose to submit it. Set it up, leave Bluetooth on, and forget about it. I've had no issues with Bluetooth connectivity interruptions or battery drain. All good. Galaxy S9+ running up-to-date Android 10.,
Alexander Wohlgemuth,1 May 2020,3,Disappointment. Installed the app on my S8 phone. No dramas. Unable to install the app on my wife's S10 phone. She is health worker. Firstly half a dozen times "invalid number", then finally accepted phone number but 6-digits PIN not coming at all. Tried with WiFi off, Bluetooth off. Gave up.,
Colin Berg,3 May 2020,4,Works well. It Sufficiently protects personal data and is stored on your own phone for 21 days. The permanent notification in the drawer is annoying. I guess they have to cater for all the old phones out there too. A setting to turn it off though would be great.,
sarah briant,7 May 2020,2,Beware of app draining battery constantly getting notifications to turn my Bluetooth on is so annoying please make the app less intrusive and also who would want a app that sends your battery life from 100% down to 5% in less than 2 hours and that's caused by COVIDsafe notifications and Bluetooth be,
Matthew Coppen,27 April 2020,5,Only rating poorly as registration was horrendous. Have Galaxy S10. Turned off wi-fi as suggested in a number of posts but still couldn't get PIN. Uninstalled and reinstalled, restarted twice, but still couldn't get PIN. Turned on "use mobile data only" in settings and finally worked.,
Tom Luo,27 April 2020,6,Overall like the concept. However, why should it need location permission when the government has continuously repeated that it won't track your location. Granted, most give Google and Facebook and a whole slew of other apps access to this information without a 2nd thought.,
Ruben Morales,26 April 2020,15,After waiting a while I was able to finish registration. Cutting Devs some slack since this was likely accomplished in weeks and no first day release for some thing like this is guaranteed no minor hiccups. Hopefully we can look forward to being able to defeat the spread and approach normalcy sooner,
Damien Rooney,27 April 2020,8,Unfortunately as others have said you can't review something you don't have. This app absolutely will not accept my phone number saying it is invalid. I have tried the obvious uninstall reinstall, ad someone else suggested turn off WiFi but still no luck. Would be helpful if there was a helpline to,
Jen D,27 April 2020,1,Once I enabled Bluetooth and turned off my Wi-Fi to use phone data the registration went straight through. Turned Wi-Fi back on and it's working perfectly. They should list these things for troubleshooting as I was getting the "please try again later" response until I did this.,
Mr Pogi,26 April 2020,9,Working perfectly.. Registration straightforward and simple. Am concerned will eat battery.. After reading the reviews from singapore.. The number 1 complaint was it kills your battery life fast.. Some said recharge 3 times in 24 hours.. Time will tell.. Hope this works.. Anything that might help sa,
Graeme Williams,27 April 2020,4,Great app but chewing battery power with bluetooth on, so leaving it off until actually going to be in close contact with someone for the required 15 minutes. We are still isolated in Victoria so cannot have visitors yet. Can stop notification in settings to stop the annoying screen alerts.,
Gavin R.,13 May 2020,2,Works fine on Samsung S7. No conflicts with any of the 4 Bluetooth speakers and headsets I regularly use for music and calls. Battery drain is no worse than when I leave Bluetooth connected all day for other purposes. App permissions do not overreach and are as restricted as promoted by the Gov.,
Scotty Dave,26 April 2020,9,Downloaded the app after 6pm, and had no problems registering. Just remember to omit the leading zero when entering your phone number. Hope the use of this app by as many people as possible will save lives and enable lockdown restrictions to be lifted sooner. Download the app and protect yourself, y,
Shakti Chittara,27 April 2020,1,We need this app and we need everyone to use it. It works as promised. Please promote this app in your networks. One improvement that can be done is that we should be able to set a home address and whenever we are there it should automatically stop the Bluetooth to avoid battery.,
Henry Vindin,26 April 2020,56,It would probably be smart to put something about registrations being unavailable until 6pm 26 Apr (as per other reviewer comments) in the description. Based on previous experience it probably won't be the play store that needs a staggering of new users downloading the app, more than likely the regi,
AmandaHarleyLouise CordialBurt,27 April 2020,4,I need help. It won't let me put my phone number in to get the pin. It says invalid number.

Keith Harvey,27 April 2020,1,Great initiative. One little thing I've noticed is normally when I loose our house wifi signal the phone goes to mobile data. When I'm back in range the wifi auto connects again. Twice today this auto reconnect hasn't happened. Not sure if it's the covid app or something else. Motorola 5gs phone.,
Tom Macnoe,2 May 2020,App works as described and doesn't use too much battery. If you are having trouble getting your phone number accepted try turning off your wifi and attempting it again. It seems to fix it for some users.,
GIRL _fromOz,3 May 2020,Needs a tweek.. Can a user set the Bluetooth so it works when we leave the house? My phone battery is draining away while I stay home with no visitors. Let us turn it off while at home and activate as we leave and go into public places. If my battery goes flat this fast it will be gone.,
Rob Corke,2 May 2020,3,Broke my Bluetooth connectivity. My phone (Moto G4+) will no longer connect to my car (Subaru). The car is adamant that there is no phone in vicinity, and phone won't find the car. Need a way to be able to temporarily disable the app for troubleshooting purposes without turning off Bluetooth.,
Arvo Elias,5 May 2020,4,No additional battery drain nor interference with 4 other Bluetooth devices. Operates even with lockscreen emergency app overlay. Simple to install and no privacy issues compared to many other country systems. Happy to recommend as a software engineer.,
Greg French,6 May 2020,22,I agree with turning on bluetooth and giving my phone number. I do NOT agree with enabling Location which the app says is compulsory for it to work. This is being misrepresented. If it is only using bluetooth to trace contact with others then Location is not necessary. Enabling Location tells Google,
Shlomo Goldzweig,17 May 2020,Used up the battery from first use. After a week of charging the phone frequently it stopped working. Had no issues until downloading the app. Would not use it. It was not a new phone but worked. Drains battery on older phones.,
Martin Trigg,26 April 2020,20,Easy to register. Not worried about privacy. Using Facebook or doing a Google search gives away more of your privacy. At least this app has some real value for society. For some reason the Play store does not find app when searching for Covidsafe but does list it when searching for Covid safe.,
Rod Kendall,7 May 2020,Phone number invalid. A half baked solution for a serious problem. Fortunately, at least the data are safe with Amazon... Update: finally allowed me to register my phone number. However, I am still uncomfortable with the Amazon connection. Three stars.,
Paul Williamson,26 April 2020,1223,This is such a great initiative and done in such a way as to make it only for one thing - keeping us safe. Please everyone install this and share it to high heaven. The phone number issue is solved now and was only because registration was not open. You should appreciate. There is an 'Upload my data,
KyE Gee,27 April 2020,13,Another LNP government fail.I have tried at least 20 times to register but every time I have been told I'm entering an 'invalid phone number' Rubbish.

Anthony Mcguigan,26 April 2020,2,This is no different to signing you life away with any other app from a third party. I'm happy to sign up. It is still you choice to upload data when it comes the time when you find out if you have Covid 19 or not. I hope people do so everyone gets informed.,
Barbra Wilson,27 April 2020,5,Would be better if it didn't chew through my battery life. Also while the 'oh no your bluetooth is off!' Warning is cute, it's annoying. Turning off my Bluetooth when at home because I prefer to only charge my phone once a day,
Vince Garrone,27 April 2020,3,Suggestion. It would be useful if the application provided feedback to the user such as how many unique contacts were encountered during the last hour, the day and perhaps the week. This might alert people to the activities with most risk and provide feedback on their social distancing technique.,
James O'Neill,8 May 2020,2,Easy, quick setup. Just uses Bluetooth (no connection) and sits in the background. Do your bit to help Australia beat this thing! Edit // Does cause the odd stutter when streaming music with bluetooth. Small price to pay for things to go back to normal.,
Amelia Dellit,28 April 2020,7,This app is useless it seems to constantly switch off, I have to keep rebooting it. Perhaps it's my Bluetooth but if people download it and think it's working properly then it is giving the community a false sense of security and inaccurate information.,
Sasha T,27 April 2020,Seems to work ok. Registration was not available after 2000hrs EST on initial release date which accounts for some of the negative reviews. Remains to be seen how many people install and run the app in terms of meeting the government's objectives.,
Ian Callander,2 May 2020,1,5 days later, doing nothing different was finally able to register on the App. Whole family downloaded the App onto each phone and no one was able to register as the App wont accept your mobile phone number with or without the 0. Pointless if you cant register....,
Satha Sandrakumar,27 April 2020,When you are at home or safe place you must have some on/off facility. When you turn off Bluetooth you need to restart the phone again which is annoying. I will recommend to download and hep the authority.,
Paul Kruger,29 April 2020,2,Easy to install and does not really drain my battery. I have had no notifications or prompts to do anything so it does not bother me at all. I am all for this process and believe this can really make a difference. Thank you to the Government and the Health Services in supporting us.,
Norma Walsh,29 April 2020,6,I cannot get through , keep saying my phone number is invalid..........I come back to get pin number go back my details are gone. I don't understand, could this be fixed, other people don't have this problem. There phone number they go straight through. Please help.....,
Frank Riley,29 April 2020,1,I have tried several times to install the App without success. The first few times it would not accept my mobile phone number When it eventually accepted my number I did not receive the code to enter into my phone I will try again at a later time but if I still have problems I will give up,
James,29 April 2020,1,There is a constant push notification 24/7 to tell you that the ap is running, quite annoying. The government is constantly tooting their horn about how many people have downloaded the app, but this doesn't reflect how many people are still using it.,
Saul Mullen,1 May 2020,1,The phone number detection cannot handle wifi-calling. Turn off your wifi, go outside or turn off wifi calling. Which is all a pretty poor start, really. Every single other app from banking to two factor authentication seems to manage this...,
Peter Muir,3 May 2020,1,I want to do my bit and despite misgivings downloaded onto Samsung Galaxy 10. Small issue. It is now making my Spotify skip every few minutes. Tried another device without the app and it worked perfectly. Same problem on my wife's phone.,
Michael Doran,5 May 2020,14,Location tracking has been turned "on" in latest update (040520) - go to the app list in settings to turn location tracking off. If this reverts to "on" in future, I'm uninstalling the app as this detail is not necessary - and govt have said app will not track location. Trust betrayed??? - sure...,
Gordon Wakelin-King,4 May 2020,2,Runs fine for me. I keep bluetooth off for battery savings while at home but turn it on when I go out for any reason. It reminds me to do that all the time, which is probably wise of it.,
Yan Z,9 May 2020,13,It makes me feel worried when requesting location, although it claimed android needs location turned on for Bluetooth to work. I have downloaded it for quite a few weeks now, but never feel comfortable to fulfill the registration. I don't really trust Google/ android for not collecting data from 3rd,
Trevor Lawrence,26 April 2020,6,Like others, I can't register. Says my phone number is invalid. News to me and those that contact me on this number. Edit: Apparently registration not available until 6pm. All ok now. Pity the back end wasn't ready when app released. On first go it interfered with Microsoft Your Phone app. Removed C,
Peter de Groot,28 April 2020,4,Installed on a Samsung S7..... 1). Why does it ask for a phone number.. surely it can get it from my phone. This bit needs work....... 2) Cannot turn phone sideways to type with these fat fingers...... 3) Wanted me to enable location ... took them at their word that it does not use it....... 4) How,
Jason Wazza,27 April 2020,13,

Catriona Lightfoot,8 May 2020,6,The app causes other Bluetooth activities such as streaming music to cut out intermittently. Very annoying. It needs an off switch for when you are home and a notification to remind you to turn on when you leave the house or car.,
Kylie G,27 April 2020,4,Edit: worked at 7.15pm. I switched from home wifi to mobile data and it worked instantly. Seems like a good idea, doesn't ask many permissions, will give it a go! Original: Says my phone no. is invalid .. can't complete registration 6.40pm 27/4/20 (Galaxy Note 9),
Ian Brennan,15 May 2020,18,Update. Finally able to register the next day. Jan still not happy. . You'd think they would of had the app bug checked by now. Considering the amount of time they have been talking about it. Not happy Jan...! So, I am a Muppet and an inpatient Troll! It now after 6pm and it still won't except my ph,
M,26 April 2020,9,Easy download. Non invasive info. Runs in the background. Like the invite you can send others to encourage to download. Anything to track covid and stay safe is gotta be good and will help us all get back to some kind of normality. Like that the gvt are trying different things.,
Stephen Szalla,27 April 2020,4,An app that might literally save my or my partner's life. Yes please! Small issue getting the PIN from the SMS then going back into the app to find I had to start the registration process again, but no major problems so far.,
AD Coupe,2 May 2020,I believe this app is the key to easing restrictions! Premieres should ease rules for those with the app first! As these people will be contactable upon exposure. Those worried about privacy need to read the details; if they are still worried, then they are best indoors as that will help keep them p,
J j,29 April 2020,4,Resquests access to location data in addition to blue tooth. The app does NOT work on IOS apple phones. It may say its running in the background, but with reduced abilities due to the way IOS is set up, the app has to be open and om the main screen for bluetooth to work here.,
Phillip Reid,2 May 2020,3,I don't mind using this app. It comes up with the message "COVIDSafe is scanning to keep you safe" and even includes a little smiley face. However, now I've found that it's not even operational! Thanks for lying to us guys.,
Judy Yorath,4 May 2020,2,I downloaded the app when it first came out but as yet I do not think I have registered my details... I am in the elderly brackets after all so technology is challenging for me! As of now Monday April 4th I have REGISTERED. Thank you all for the very good work you are doing to help protect us and ke,
Stefan Kleynhans,10 May 2020,Since installing the app my Bluetooth earphones seem to be a bit glitchy.. The sound is very broken with short pauses in between. A friend experiences the same (both Samsung, but different brands of earphones).. Would be great to get this fixed. It is pretty annoying.,
Kate A.,13 May 2020,1,

GP McGee,19 May 2020,2,Unistalled due to not being able to turn off the notification bar. It interrupts the functionality of the drop down notifications of other other apps. Should be able to run covid app in the background without constant notification showing.,
The Bakers,20 May 2020,1,The app doesn't recognise my phone number as being a valid Australian mobile number. I have had this number for nearly 20 years. It's definitely entered correctly. But is classed as "invalid",
Mike S,2 May 2020,4,FEEDBACK TO DEVELOPERS: You should have the number of downloads visible in the app (live) to motivate people to share and reach the 3 million then 5 million then 10million download goals - with a share option next to the live count. It would make people more keen to open the app and talk about it /,
Andrew Milton,27 April 2020,2,If you get the Invalid Phone Number error, turn your Wi-Fi off and switch to mobile data and it should work... did for me anyway. Developers should either insert this instruction into the installation, or fix this bug with Wi-Fi.,
steve,27 April 2020,1,If you are getting an 'invalid number' error, don't try adding the leading zero it won't fix the problem, INSTEAD turn off your WIFI and use cellular data. You can turn your WIFI back on once the registration is complete,
Stefanovich R,27 April 2020,Works as stated, smooth and concise. Bad reviews were just premature downloaders. Unlike facebook or instagram which you no doubt use and tag people in, this is not sharing that type of information with random companies. Delete it once this is over. Even for the safety of those around you, friends f,
A N,26 April 2020,3,It's not going to compromise your privacy as you can put a pseudoname and it's just age range, not DOB. No more privacy invading than entering a lucky draw competition. The downside is it was my battery. My phone isn't crash hot, so has less battery capacity.,
Larry,5 May 2020,8,Not compatible with my mother's older model phone. I suspect this is going to be an issue for a lot of older people who need this the most, because they tend to have hand-me-down phones from their children. Mum's phone should be capable to handle the app. It's a Galaxy S5,
Jamie Good,27 April 2020,2,Wont recognise my mobile number. Unable to find a help line or webpage to assist me with the issue. Update: Turn off wifi and verify mobile number in data mode. It wouldnt recognise either mine or my partners mobile numbers until we turned wifi off.,
Shayne Boswell,27 April 2020,3,Obviously it's a good thing to have, but having Bluetooth on all the time is a battery drain, and on my S10, there is a constant notification on my lock screen? If it was using 4G or wifi that would be better and remove the notification it's distracting and unnecessary.,
Noel Murrell,27 April 2020,6,No problems downloading or registering. My only concern is that a lot of people may miss out as the phone must have Android 6 or higher. A lot of older (the ones you are trying to protect) or less tech savvy will have older Android phones.,
joe menta,27 April 2020,31,Needs a "At home" button. App seems ok, still not sure of impact on battery but a simple I'm at home button would mean it doesn't need to stay on while I'm home. Even a message every hour asking am I at home would help people remember to turn it on if needed. Good idea just needs some refinement,
Darren Cox,28 April 2020,I can't get past the confirm mobile number step to receive a PIN. Tried entering my mobile number with a 0 and without a 0 after the country code but both times, it won't generate a PIN. No spaces in my number either. Tried installing and reinstalling but no luck. Mobile number is with Telstra on a,
Vikki Mount,26 April 2020,109,100% on board with the idea but this app shouldn't have been launched until registration could happen. Lots of frustration with people unable to register their phone number. This will cause a lot of users to dismiss the app with one star.,
Marianne Giang,27 April 2020,3,Not accepting mobile number during installation process, hence unable to generate PIN. I m sure the mob no. Is correct. I gave up after few attempts. Need to fix problem. Post paid mob for more than 5 yrs. Need to fix problem.,
Sheldon Rautenbach,28 April 2020,8,Works fine with no issues, my original review said it drained battery but after a few days of trying it, I can't see a massive issue especially considering my Bluetooth watch is paired to the phone all day anyway. No excuse to not have the app installed now.,
Phelec59,27 April 2020,2,Easy to Install - Great for All Not are you helping to stop the spread especially to the vulnerable, but you will be helping the unemployed get back to work again sooner. This app is not just about health, but more so about helping the economy (read: JOBS) getting on track again. If you are affected,
Frank S,27 April 2020,2,Found, downloaded and installed OK, verified with phone number/pin etc. But the actual app does not show up on my Samsung Note9 list of apps. The Covid Safe icon is on my taskbar and notifications drop down. Clicking on notification opens App, but actual App icon on my "Desktop" or homepage is not a,
Ricky Beca-Cherrett,27 April 2020,2,For once the Gov has done a good job in creating an app which is actually privacy-friendly, with strong legal protections to back it up. As a privacy advocate and software developer, this is the first app from the Gov that I'm actually happy to have installed on my phone.,
Rob Adams,26 April 2020,163,Unable to register, tells me my phone number is invalid, tried with and without the leading zero.... Seriously, if your going to release an app you ensure that everything is ready to go before it happens. Not sure what kind of backend is missing that can't parse a phone number, that's normally done,
Elizabeth Liang,29 April 2020,Was quick and easy to create an account. They prompt you to read the T&Cs, which you should be going through anyway, and ask your phone for permissions. Whole process took less than 3 minutes, highly recommend others to install the app too,
Peter Robson,29 April 2020,2,Brilliant idea to restrict the spread of the virus. Is 15 minutes contact per event too long? The likelihood of virus transfer between passersby in a much shorter time is not insignificant . But then again it would be too intrusive. What we have is the best compromise. Peter Robson,
Les Kenna,29 April 2020,2,No problem installing and going through the registration process was easy. I view using this app as being about protecting myself, family, friends and community. Privacy risk is meaningless when comes to a life and death situation.,
Chun Man Tsui,30 April 2020,3,Get it running people and join the community to fight against the virus. Taiwan and Singapore has been doing this for a long while, especially Taiwan and no one there is complaining about invasion to privacy while they have the virus all under control. And beside, nothing stops you from uninstalling,
George Eldon,2 May 2020,2,Keeps closing by itself. I don't have any privacy issue with it but whenever I check to see if it is still open, usually many hours after having opened it, it is inevitably closed. Not good if it is a bug. I am absolutely not inadvertently closing it myself,
Imogen Groves,3 May 2020,2,Drains the life out of your battery, which is incredibly annoying and unsafe if you need to be out and about alone for work . Constant notification you can't get rid of gets annoying pretty quick too. Had to uninstall,
Sapient Man,2 May 2020,1,Installation easy on Android. App requests location access. Checked and information confirms it doesn't collect location. My GPS is always off anyway, and app works fine without it on. Forced stop for now as we are still in lockdown and I haven't been face to face with anyone for weeks üòä,
Gerard Stainsby,14 May 2020,6,Presumably working quietly in the background. Pleasing that the source code has been made available. A persistent, slightly irritating and presumptuous "keeping you safe" badge cannot be easily hidden but at least will remind me to delete the app when/if the need is passed.,
Robert Angus,7 May 2020,12,Stupid system to load the app. I got a gov message on my mobile phone and followed the steps to download the app to my Samsung mobile. It is now downloaded to my iPad which does not leave the house and some equipment that was my iPhone about 6 months ago but now sits in a cupboard with no microchip.,
Steven Donnison,10 May 2020,9,I installed this app, and through the setup process it informed me that for it to work, it is mandatory for me to give my permission for it to access my location. A major red flag for me, so i like many others will be uninstalling this app immediately after i submit this review. They say that it's a,
Tim Kojevnikov,15 May 2020,1,Works as intended. Bluetooth doesn't drain the battery as badly as expected. I would come home with ~80% battery charge if I didn't use it for anything else (such as GPS, etc). It's worth the minor hassle in a exchange for our freedom,
Daniel Connolly,28 April 2020,1,What's to dislike? It's an essential. My phone has a firewall feature and I just block it with a firewall anyway, though it doesn't seem to use any internet access at all - only GPS and Bluetooth. Battery drain is unchanged from what I notice, even after turning off battery saver to make sure it's a,
Jake P,28 April 2020,2,Install this app today. If you're worried about battery usage, charge your phone at home more often, or turn off your bluetooth at home. As has been the digital/internet requirement for years; drop the 0 on your Australian 04xx number if you have rego issues.,
JW Gator,26 April 2020,4,If you're reading this on a mobile phone, you have already given away more personal information than this app will ever want from you. Do you use Google? Or Google Maps? Yes? Well they have much more personal information about you than this app. Help the medical staff conduct their tracing. Help Aus,
Rod Chandler,27 April 2020,Pin number should be given at start of completion of Ap.if not familiar with op of smart phones elderly lose info when attempting to retrieve pin number. Too many assumptions are made without consideration of experience of user.took me 3 attempts to work it out. Finally got there but frustrating.,
Desmond Soares,27 April 2020,2,The app bluetooth polling interested with my use of the phone as a wifi hotspot causing the internet to drop out every few minutes. I am using. Moto e5. This means I will turn of. Bluetooth when running a wifi hotspot. Please fix.,
Ian White,27 April 2020,2,Tried installing multiple times gets to 97 percent then stops. What to do? Samsung s10 so i went into apps google play clear cache clear data and tried again. Same result stops at 97 percent downloaded. Latter google asked me to login again with my gmail address this appeared to clear the issue and,
Jean Haynes,27 April 2020,1,I had multiple attempts to register my number (and to receive PIN) but it kept rejecting as "invalid phone number". As suggested by another review, I switched off wifi for this step and used mobile data instead - it registered instantly.,
Graham Johnstone,30 April 2020,1,After entering my mobile number the log in process freezes. I dropped the 0 so I don't understand why this happened. Tried several times from scratch with the same results. Ok after another attempt, so now have the app,
t2d66 D,29 April 2020,1,Bluetooth speaker connected to Spotify stopping. I press play & it's stops again. This is the only new app I've installed. I think there a bug and this is the only different thing (new app) on my device. Had to clear memory to get Bluetooth speaker working. Galaxy Note 8.,
John Macdonald,14 May 2020,2,Wording is better in the new version. App can get better. Still requires location access. Took 8 hrs to pop up. Not impressed. Only needs one phone in the immediate area to have location on, but..... We were told it didn't track. Semantics?,
sushi whisperer,9 May 2020,3,In order to connect to a Bluetooth device all you should need is Bluetooth permission. The fact that some application may use the Bluetooth connection to determine location, should not force the user to give that app even more permissions. Forcing enabling location is wrong.,
Rob Sheridan,11 May 2020,2,Have to turn bluetooth off to use wifi for some reason now when at home why I'm not sure. Will forget to turn on/off eventually. Have to allow my location which gives my home address. Been trying to avoid this ever since coroner spolated evidence to cover-up how sister met her end but now this is op,
Ben Howell,13 May 2020,Idea is good but it keeps interfering with my Bluetooth headphones, randomly it will cause them to cutout for a few seconds. Doesn't happen that often but enough to be annoying.,
Brad Hawkes,20 May 2020,Has always been active and there hasn't been any noticeable change in battery life. I guess if I get coronavirus, or someone around me does, then I'll know if it's actually doing it's job. No complaints from me though.,
Matthew Wheatley,12 May 2020,5,Unobtrusive and very small battery drain. Random shutdown on Android was traced to battery settings on my phone. Opened the App power-saver manager and turned off optimize and auto control. There might be some different answers but I haven't had a problem since doing that.,
Ram Ellimisetty,27 April 2020,2,It is simple and think it is safe and does not breach privacy and not much information is sorted. Once the restrictions are relaxed this app will definitely speed up tracing the contacts. Hope many will download and help all to keep everyone safe.,
nick tait,28 April 2020,Major issue with the covid app. When I need to use Bluetooth it starts auto calling the last number I rang. Like in the car. While driving. I can't stop it unless I turn the Bluetooth off on my phone.,
John Scolaro,27 April 2020,3,For what it is, it's a well made app. The vibe I got from it was that privacy would be respected and user data will remain secure which is important, since all the app does is track people. Keep it up devs, you're doing good work.,
Simon Bellworthy,28 April 2020,I've just downloaded the app and all good up until it asks for your phone number, I've entered a dozen times and says not valid. I've reinstalled it twice still nothing. Removed the zero. No.point it if it don't work,
Booboo Kittiefukk,26 April 2020,19,Easy to set up. The only permission it asks for is location data and it makes sure your bluetooth is on, which is no problem. No data leaves your phone and it's easy to generate that information if you are ever asked to provide it by a health official.,
Beth Masterson,27 April 2020,1,Quick and easy to install. Great level of information provided to reassure me how the data will be used, if it helps save lives worth every download. I truly hope it works as intended, brilliant tool to protect the community.,
Terry Evans,4 May 2020,2,Took me 3 days to get out to download. Kept saying my phone number was wrong. Now that I have it, I turned Bluetooth on but it keeps flashing on and off. I've tried deleting app and reloading it several times. Does anyone have this problem?,
jeff Pethybridge,27 April 2020,2,Easy install. Read the help for why it wants but don't need Location turned on. Also it explicitly states that Government and law enforcement can not use it to check social distancing or meetings. Annoyed that a warning notification stays active while the app is running.,
Edmond Stewart,27 April 2020,2,Using this app is a small but important step we can take. Phone number not registering? Try turning off WiFi and using your mobile network. That solved my issue (also don't forget to leave the first zero of your phone number out),
Andrea Piels,26 April 2020,2,Very easy to register. Only supplied name, age group, postcode and mobile number. Nothing whatsoever to worry about. Can be uninstalled at any time. I recommend for your own safety, download and register.,
Han-Wei Lee,5 May 2020,1,I hope the Devs can fix the issue with this app killing Bluetooth headsets, I need my Bluetooth headset working as I'm on the phone for hours per day. Maybe even a pause button if the headset wireless issues can't be fixed.,
Andrew McSeveney,5 May 2020,3,This app does not kill your battery, it does not listen as you sleep at night, it does not even track your GPS data, nor does it sell your personal data to companies who want to market to you. What does it do then? Well it might just save your life, or someone you care about. Take 5 minutes, downloa,
Leighton Davis,13 May 2020,11,The Australia logo with the tick still appears in the status bar when Bluetooth is off, although the detailed text in the notification tray changes. Maybe a different icon to indicate that the app is not active would be easier to alert that the app needs to be checked?,
Andrew Graham,18 May 2020,I've noticed the same issues too with my music too. Spotify was cutting out on my car speakers. I have updated the app today, so let's see if this fixes the issues. Apart from this the App has had no other faults with me.,
Tim Parker,16 May 2020,1,The app is very asthetic! It really doesn't use that much battery and you can disable the permanent notification within Android. I had support for high refresh rate displays which is a nice touch. I'm impressed they made it so quickly. Download this app!üëç,
TheRealDrGiles,18 May 2020,When I'm at home listening to music via Bluetooth, the app causes regular dropouts. I have to kill the app when home and reactivate it when out and about. It needs some work.,
Adam Thompson,27 April 2020,10,Privacy policy says "No location data (data that could be used to track your movements) will be collected at any time." Then the app asks for permission to use location data. Not sure why it needs this permission it if does not use the data?,
Daniel James,6 May 2020,1,Important application. Doesn't use as much battery as I was expecting. If you have an Oppo phone you need to go into phone settings, applications, COVIDSafe to stop to phone from managing the applications power use.,
Alan C,27 April 2020,2,How do I ensure only this application and no other I have on my phone access my location or uses my Bluetooth connection? Normally I keep location, Bluetooth, and phone data turned of to stop other applications I have using it for reasons they do not adiquitly explain to my satisfaction. Some of the,
Rob Hampton,27 April 2020,1,I kept getting invalid phone number. I turned off WIFI on my phone and then it worked/registered straight away. Should have better error messages. Should have Unable to verify phone number and turn WIFI off to register.,
Rachel Montgomery,27 April 2020,I think this is a great idea, but the constant notification telling me that it's searching is really annoying! I don't like having notifications so if there were a way I could get rid of this I'd be so much happier!,
VT Mukundan,26 April 2020,App is designed for minimum data / maximum privacy and control. Obviously the app increases our reopening options. Australia rise to the occasion once more and install now. Hats off to all parties for getting it ready, only wish it had been available sooner,
J _,26 April 2020,12,This app could save my life. I'm more than happy to let others have a record of having come into contact with me if they become ill with COVID-19. If I get sick then others can be informed if they have been in contact with me. Not being able to tell other people I'm sick won't be on my conscience. T,
G Calkin,26 April 2020,5,Works well, simple to install, and more than happy to help get rid of this awful virus. My husband is immunocompromised and it's given us some peace of mind knowing that either of us can be contacted if we've had any contact with it.,
Erol Mintie,26 April 2020,13,Updated review. All good. Easy to register and nicely developed. App notification saying it's running on home screen notifications which should be visible all the time so you know the app is running in the background. Well done! Let's hope we get greater uptake than Singapore (20%)!,
Darryl Ward,26 April 2020,5,Such an easy sign up process, app is very straight forward to use and the amount of personal information being captured is negligible. People really need to understand the facts and give this a go before playing the usual anti government card.,
Michael Stuart,27 April 2020,2,Very easy to set up. For those struggling with the phone number recognition, do not put in the 0, as it will not recognise your number with the +61 in front of it. Common sense, but two comments already complaining about this.,
Peter Gapp,29 April 2020,2,I have tried to install it, I am told it is already installed I have no icons on phone to indicate installation. Too hard I give up. On the official site there is lots of information but no links, I used SA Govt site, incredibly frustrating,going in circles. Get it right.,
Christophe Garrec,29 April 2020,2,Same experience as many other when connected to audio devices. If CovidSafe is running the audio cuts off every 10 to 20 seconds. The app need to be killed before listening to music.,
MYEVENTIN AUSTRALIA,30 April 2020,3,I don't have any experience yet. But 5 stars for the great app. The app lets users to use one mobile numbers on multiple devices that I had come across on the 26 of April. I don't know it still allows multiple users for a same number.,
Devin North,2 May 2020,5,While the Covid Safe app is running, it interrupts music playing through Bluetooth every minute or so when in the car. Music stops and starts again constantly. This has happpened in two differrent cars with two different phones.,
Jessie Lou,3 May 2020,2,Battery lasts half a day. Haven't touched my phone all day. I took my phone off charge at 9am, now it's 1pm and I'm down to 50% battery. The only thing different was downloading this last night. Will have to uninstall.,
Zoe L,9 May 2020,5,I open it and nothing happens. It just stays on the first screen. I see no buttons to push our no way to get out of the first screen. It also changes my top status bar to white and my bottom menu bar to white too. All my icons are white so everything stops being visable.,
Paul Smit,5 May 2020,I am using a Samsung Note8. Battery power is not impacted, neither are issues found on my active Bluetooth devices with the COVIDSafe now installed. If notifications bother you, simply block the notifications from this app.,
Pat P,6 May 2020,2,The unnecessary notification cannot be cleared for some reason and it keeps Bluetooth on all the time. There is no option to disable it when you are home. It just wastes battery life.,
sam affara,10 May 2020,All was good till this last update. Now it says I'm not connected and to check permissions. I did and it still didn't work.. I restarted my phone but that didn't help either. I just uninstalled and reinstalled it seems to have worked,
Tommy Dennis,12 May 2020,1,Trying to do the right thing, was happy to download but have had numerous issues with Bluetooth connectivity, especially handsfree in my car which i need for work randomly disconnecting. Have had to uninstall as this is dangerous and distracting while driving.,
Jaime Lancaster,13 May 2020,No issue signing up but it's sucking the life out of my battery. Having to put phone on charge upto 3 extra times a day. Please fix this issue before life goes back to "normal".,
Christine Russell,26 April 2020,1,Found it really easy to install and set up.Great initiative by the government to help us track and control this disease and help everyone get their lives back on track and ease restrictions.The more people sign up the more effective.As they say "We're all in this together ",
Maree Newhouse,27 April 2020,2,Great application if turn off your wifi and use your mobile data to install. I had been trying all day and kept getting the message 'invalid phone number'. It wasn't until I turned wifi off and used mobile data that the PIN finally came through.,
Allan Eadie,26 April 2020,4,Easy registration. Totally voluntary. Yes you have to provide a phone number but if you think about it how else will they contact you if you have come into contact with someone who tests positive. 4 stars as we just need to see if this is actually going to make a difference.,
David Thurlow,27 April 2020,3,A very simple and important app. Most of my other apps collect my data so that it can be sold to advertising companies. This one will hopefully prevent and slow the spread of a global pandemic. Seems worthwhile to me.,
Bob Tomkins,28 April 2020,3,Well intended idea, but won't accept my phone number in any way, shape, or form. Giving up! I assume the numbers of downloads the government are touting are from people uninstalling and reinstalling the app, not actual people using the app.,
andystar,26 April 2020,2,Enrollment was pretty easy, the app is always running in the background but so far doesn't appear to be using the battery at all. Would trust it more if they used the Google/Apple framework, but sounds like that's a few weeks away..,
Happy Traveler 99,26 April 2020,4,Straight forward to install and register. App appears to capture a lot less than Google and Facebook so happy to play my part in helping to protect myself, my family and fellow Aussies and help us all get back to some form of normality sooner.,
Reg,26 April 2020,3,Perfect. Blue tooth on is a bit of a hassle but it's free, simple, easy to register and really no issues at all about it running. Seems stable. Happy to use it. All these privacy freaks are a wart on the arse of progress.,
Federico Collarte,26 April 2020,1,It asked me for accessing to my device location. I understood this would not be required, it would only track interactions based on proximity not location. But I was able to register without any problem, and most other functions work well,
Dev Hen,28 April 2020,4,

Azrael Raven,26 April 2020,204,Will not accept my mobile number in registration process... Had the same number for almost 20 years but apparently now it's invalid Plus why the +61 bit? We already know it's Australia all that does is confuse people who aren't familiar with that format... Clearly an app written by a government agen,
L Innes,26 April 2020,1,For anyone mentioning that they don't want Bluetooth on, this app uses Bluetooth to register other people (phones) that you have been in contact with. If you turn Bluetooth off, this app will not work how it's supposed to.,
Mark Agius,28 April 2020,1,Great idea. It will filter out those that have come close to someone who later has been tested and found to have COVID19 and so these people will be notified as opposed to those who haven't been anywhere near someone who was later tested and found to have COVID19.,
Club Heat,28 April 2020,9,Only downloaded because Scomo blackmail saying we won't open up untill enough people download. It's dumb anyway, I could walk past someone and catch it in 2 seconds if the sneeze, and the app wouldn't register, it's doesn't take 15 min to catch, it takes just the right conditions, sunlight kills it.,
Rebecca March,26 April 2020,62,When I entered my phone number and pressed the button to receive my code it said to try again later. If the government wants a large amount of people to cooperate and use this app it will not help if we encounter these kind of frustrations. Also it took a bit to find out what this app is called, tha,
Jeremiah Lim,27 April 2020,2,No issues with privacy. But undismissable notification is really annoying. Work around is to go to settings and turn off Foreground notification and Notification Dot. Not sure if I will miss important alerts this way..,
Bridget Mcpherson,27 April 2020,3,UPDATED - was told to switch wifi off, but was already off so switched on and registered with no problem, yeay. So many saying invalid phone number, they might have mentioned it ü§£ Same as other reviews, uploaded on my phone fine, tried to do hubby mobile stuck at invalid phone number,
A Google user,28 April 2020,3,The app won't accept my phone number when registering to receive the PIN, it keeps coming up that my number is invalid. I have tried dropping the zero from the beginning of the number and I have also tried including the zero and either way it won't accept it???,
Esther McLauchlan,2 May 2020,2,I have tried several times to install this, but it won't send a PIN number. I have tried all the suggestions - turn off wifi etc tried to register at various times of the day... But the number just won't come through.,
Ian Bell,2 May 2020,2,Apologies Mr PM I regard this as an important tool to assist in the control of Covid-19 but as the Bluetooth on my phone doesn't work and I have no intention of purchasing new phone for this purpose I won't be able to add to the number of installs. BTW. Apparently my wife's phone is too old so she i,
Rickson Philip Lewis,1 May 2020,1,Better late than never! I sincerely wish this virus is exterminated asap, I am doing my part to keep us safe and get us up and running. Very well designed app, faced no issues whatsoever!,
Linda Lawrence,2 May 2020,5,My samsung phone is pre 6.0 so it's not compatible. Support suggested checking the faq's page which I did and confirmed not compatible. If the govt wants approx 40% of the population to download, they'll need to make it compatible. I'm obviously not going to buy a new phone just for the app.,
Michael O'Keefe,17 May 2020,1,took 4 attempts to install the app. the screen froze several times. √Äfter installing this app, my mobile connection regularly dropped out. There is not much use to having a locator app if there is no mobile connection. So I uninstalled the app from my phone,
tony,8 May 2020,Have to delete it on trips in my car where I use Bluetooth for music as it keeps unpairing with the stereo. Otherwise I assume it's doing what it's supposed to. Anything to get out of this lockdown mess.,
Liz Grimwood-Taylor,10 May 2020,Simple, works in the background and haven't noticed any impact on my battery. Has been designed with data minimisation and privacy in mind. Everyone should be downloading this app to do their bit in the fight against Covid-19!,
Ray Bradbury,11 May 2020,2,When in proximity of another phone running the app it causes interference with BT audio devices, causing music or podcasts to pause repeatedly for 2 to 5 seconds. Makes it unusable and force stopping it while listening is the only way to stop the interference.,
Harley D,15 May 2020,Great idea, but I keep having issues with the battery optimisation on my Oppo Reno Z, even though I've turned my battery optimisation off and given the app full background running permission. If this is going to work it needs to work on all devices.,
Bianca Froggy,28 April 2020,Won't validate my number, and yes I dropped the zero. Then I tried with the zero in case they changed it to help those who don't know you're supposed to drop the zero. Still didn't work.,
Arwen Ogilvy,27 April 2020,3,I really want to do the right thing and have this app on my phone but the battery is draining so fast! Only had it unplugged for 40 mins and already down to 90%. I'm at home so not even coming in contact with phones other than my husband. I hope this is just a teething problem...,
The Equalizer 2014,28 April 2020,1,I'm sick of the "We Need You!" NAG Notification when I switch off my Bluetooth when I'm at home for the same reason I switch off WiFi when I leave home -- because it's not required and to conserve battery power.,
Ralph Ward,27 April 2020,1,Works fine for me, easy to setup. Uses Bluetooth but can still use my headset and connect to the car fine. It has access to very little permission wise and Android hasn't recorded it sending any data. Can't see what the fuss is about,
tomshirvo1,26 April 2020,42,I think you need to explain that the location permission is required for Bluetooth to be used. Maybe provide a link to the Android documentation showing why Bluetooth needs location permissions. I nearly deleted until I investigated more. Happy with the app and recommend people use it.,
Rob McCormack,27 April 2020,44,Simple installation. Those who got the invalid phone number message (like I did) were trying to register before 6pm. Worked fine after that. This app makes sense and will help to protect me, my family, the community and our health workers, as well as speeding up our return to normal life.,
Charlie Ping,26 April 2020,2,Worked flawlessly. For those that tried to activate before the government said it was ready, it would be nice if you updated your 1 star reviews. And yes, the government should have waited to launch it but it's fixed now.,
Planet Saturn,26 April 2020,6,Very easy to install. Just where it says 'wrong number?' (to confirm the number), people might think they've put in a wrong number. It should say 'is this the correct number. do you want to change the number?',
Chelsea Hantken,26 April 2020,3,I'm happy to have the app on my phone, I'm not worried about any security risks. But I removed one star because Bluetooth is constantly running and there's an icon in my notification tray which won't disappear which is annoying.,
Chris Coughlan,26 April 2020,18,An essential app for these times. For those complaining about the phone number - just don't use the 0 at the beginning of your number. It's not hard and that format has been around for decades. It's the international standard. Government doesn't get much right but this is fine.,
Richard Penfold,27 April 2020,I fully support this app however unfortunately I can't register because it is telling me my phone number is invalid (this occurred to me after the registration process was opened after the initial delay).,
Adam Simic,2 May 2020,1,A suggestion, please give us the ability to turn the app "off" when not needed. I don't need the app running 24/7, especially considering I only go outside for an hour also everyday. I can't be the only one that would find this useful?,
Samantha Perera,3 May 2020,1,Should show the Name, Number of days it has been on the phone and if I am recorded as "infected or not". That way the "Lock Down" can be eased as long as people have the app. Also older versions of Oppo doesn't alow the installation.,
Paul BROWN,3 May 2020,5,Was going to use but you also need to bc activate location info for google. I have never allowed location permission and won't now. Dont see why it is needed if bluetooth speaks to another phone with the covid ap and each has name and contact number. I dont let google track me.,
Chris Richardson,5 May 2020,2,My phone battery is draining really fast since installing this. Have to recharge at least twice during the day with normal use. Plus my phone is running hot all the time.,
Rod Cunningham,4 May 2020,Have installed the App on my wife's Samsung A20. When using the app with an Ultimate Ears Boom 3 (Bluetooth) speaker the sound cuts of every 2 or so minutes for 5 to 10 seconds. Have uninstaller the app and it's now OK..,
Cere Jewell,10 May 2020,3,I understand it's purpose but it drains your phone's battery so fast that it's become an annoyance. It needs a 'home' option so that it isn't constantly searching for other's with the app and killing battery life.,
david yeo,12 May 2020,2,Cannot install this app. althugh mobile has the required Android 6.0.0 and Bluetooth installed and switched on. After giving all the required details and retrieving the PIN for this app. and enter this into the app., this does not successfully install this app. into my mobile.,
Ruben Sanchez Moragues,15 May 2020,1,Downloaded and installed without any issue. It doesn't drain the battery. Safe and not tracking where one goes. No privacy concerns at all. I hope more people download it. This is a smart way to beat the virus all together.,
Leon Mand,16 May 2020,The latest update (with the green Australia symbol) is chewing my battery at idle. It uses 10% per hour when my phone is idle. Was fine until the latest update. You need to fix this. UNINSTALLING.,
Liam Cahill,15 May 2020,1,Great is concept however it doesn't appear to work on my phone. For some reason the app keeps turning the Bluetooth off on my phone. Will bump up to 5 stars when a fix is rolled out.,
Christopher Woulfe,18 May 2020,1,There are a few apps. Guess which one is the tracker. Most of us are not super enthusiastic about being tracked but we know what it is. If I can't control the Bluetooth, I will remove the tracker. The phone is useless with a flat battery.,
Vittoria L,17 May 2020,I don't mind the app but I don't understand wire displays how many minutes and the time when I pull down my home screen and it's running in the background what do the minutes mean? Eg: covidsafe 12m ??,
Kimble Young,27 April 2020,Installation and configuration went smoothly. The only personally identifiable information it asks for is your phone number. You can use a fake name if you wish. More happy to give up that tiny bit of privacy vs what we give up to Google/Apple/FB etc.,
joanne gilbert,27 April 2020,3,It will not let me register my number. Just has a pop up that says invalid number. Please fix as it seems from other reviews I'm not the only one with this issue. I'm an android user... not sure if that helps.,
Susan Bolvary,26 April 2020,4,It downloaded perfectly and I was able to register. Remember to perhaps not include the first zero in your mobile number when you register. If you tried earlier today, it may not have worked as they did say from 6pm.,
Martin Truran,27 April 2020,19,Happy with security, easy setup, let's face it- if it saves even one life then it's worth doing. Not a big ask for the potential benefits to us all. Please notice that most of the bad reviews are from people who didn't read the instructions regarding the start time for registration.,
Michaela Truppel,26 April 2020,25,Registration process was done in less than 3 min. Easy as...... All the 1 star comments,geez ppl give it some time. Looks like the issues were -mostly- sorted within a day. App is now running in the background as it's supposed to, let's see how my battery will like it.,
Allan Bruse,27 April 2020,2,Downloaded. Tried to register. Got as far as entering my phone number to send a code. Apparently I don't know my own phone number ('number invalid'). I can't be bothered despite all of the hype. Such a good idea wasted.,
Andrew Dobson,26 April 2020,It's asking for location permissions. Got this response from the support team. "Android/Google requires all apps that request access to Bluetooth¬Æ to also obtain location permission. As a result, COVIDSafe on Android asks for location permissions because they are needed for Bluetooth¬Æ permissions. C,
Oxana Repina,26 April 2020,2,The app is simple to set up and very carefully explains the privacy information. It collects a whole lot LESS info than most of the other apps on my phone (eg google). Happy to keep it running.,
Daniel Dunstan,26 April 2020,3,Works well, easy set up, can change app permission preferences without breaking the app if you're concerned, and it's a simple first name last name age range and phone number info required. So it's honestly nothing to stress about. Let's stay safe guys ü§ô,
Robert D,28 April 2020,2,App states that I have been tested positive for covid19 immediately after download. I have not been tested and have no symptoms and self quaranteened 4 2 weeks even though requirement to do so. Do not know what is going on with the App!!!,
Daniel M,27 April 2020,1,So far, so good. No obvious battery drain. Saves on having to wrack my brain about whom I've met; if and when contact tracing becomes necessary.,
Soren Cicchini,29 April 2020,5,Incompatible with my mother's Samsung Galaxy J1 running Android 5.1.1. To be useful as a public health measure, this really needs to have broader compatibility to allow use by people other than those with the latest and greatest hardware.,
Amanda Pryce,1 May 2020,1,The constant notification in the notification bar is very annoying. Like... I think I might uninstall it because of that. It keeps trucking my thinking I have an actual notification, and shows up on my lock screen too.,
Jian-Paul Nuzzo,1 May 2020,2,Easy to install and use. Drains battery but small price to pay for safety. Suggest the developers consider a safe zone so that the app isn't working as hard when you're at home.,
Darren Grant,2 May 2020,1,Everything was working fine until I needed to use bluetooth in my car. It wouldn't connect, then found it wouldn't connect on any other bluetooth device until I uninstalled tha app. I am using a Note 8.,
Dean Lewis,2 May 2020,Have not tested positive or seen how the app is used as yet, but thus far am extremely thankful that the government had the app written, flowing the Bluetooth to hand-shake approach to not location track individuals.,
Ryan Crittenden,4 May 2020,Easy to set-up, doesn't drain battery, does not have gas tracking like sheep believe. Seriously if you are an Australian citizen download the app. If the government wants your details there are other means..,
Damien Brown,1 May 2020,1,Absolute rubbish I've tried 6 different times doing all different combos with location, blue tooth, Wi-Fi all on or off. The app says it is totally installed and running but I have no Covidsafe shield icon on the screen. Yes I've tried turning it off n on,
Robin Brar,5 May 2020,5,App isn't working it's stuck on my Samsung S10+ I was reading terms and conditions and after that It got stuck tried to clear app data and restart but still same it stuck on home logo and no idea what's up with it. My device was rooted before maybr it doesn't work well on rooted devices. I hope they,
Deb Barnes,7 May 2020,5,This thing drains my battery. I used to only charge every second day, now I have to charge daily, sometimes twice a day. And this is on a Samsung S20, so not an old phone at all,
Glenn Thomas,13 May 2020,1,Won't stay active on my Oppo phone, keep having to allow battery optimisation setting, works for no more than 10 minutes and becomes inactive again, so completely pointless even having it installed at the moment.,
sara whitmee,14 May 2020,2,Probably going to uninstall. The app has what is meant to have a permanent notification that sys if it disappears to restart your phone however with mine it turns battery optimisation off so I constantly have to go in to turn it back on to make the app work.,
Don Black,26 April 2020,1,Good but the verification pin could have been automatically performed on Android (-1 star). Our company App puts the verification code in for you on receipt of the sms....so I would assume our government could do better. I will most probably update my review after a week.,
Lila CC,26 April 2020,3,Excellent idea and I believe it offers far more privacy than a lot of my other apps. It's just running quietly in the background and there have been no noticeable effects on battery or performance as yet.,
Stuart Whiteway,27 April 2020,5,Simple, put your name and phone number in and just let it run in the background. The information is encrypted and stays on your phone until a healthcare professional asks for it in the case you test positive. It will go a long way to t reace the disease. . . Approved,
Satya Prasad N,28 April 2020,2,Relatively easy to setup. However the app doesnt provide any way to download the data that it is collecting about me. That would increase the transparency and let more people install it.,
Olivia Shields,27 April 2020,3,Got as far as entering my name and postcode, but repeatedly received the error message "invalid phone number" when I tried to enter it. It's definitely my phone number but until the app recognises it I can't begin using it. Unhelpful.,
Darrell Roberts,27 April 2020,1,Very happy to download this app. If needed by medical personnel, the information gathered will help to assist with contacting people that may have come into contact with a coronavirus carrier, and that can only be a good thing. The naysayers and scaremongers need to grow up and download this app to,
Andrew Heard,29 April 2020,6,I've read 42+ reviews of people receiving an Invalid Phone Number error. One mentioned problems if registering before 6pm. One mentioned needing to "waiting a while". One mentioned it took several attempts. None of these apply to me, and I still get the error. My 9 digit phone number is definitely v,
Jen G,27 April 2020,3,5 stars to breaching your privacy Australian Government. Check the app permissions which wants your location, full name & age. Use a fake name? Don't worry, the full network access & location data has your real identity. Check the lack of privacy policy which states the Government wants to know the,
Michael Stanton,26 April 2020,2,Quick & Easy. Doesn't require any personal information that isn't already in the wild. Please download this app. Very good reviews from everyone who realises that it only went online just before 6. Very easy.,
Chris Lamming,27 April 2020,Easy to install and security is not a concern with data stored only for 21 days. A great concept to help with public health and safety. Download and install uptake also a key KPI to ease restrictions.,
Paul,6 May 2020,2,Easy to install and setup. Close it and it sits in the background. Minimal battery use. Tin foil hat not supplied. Pay no attention to partisan paranoid armchair software engineers.,
Andrew Fionik,26 April 2020,18,The program looks okay. We are yet to see it's efficiency. However, one serious drawback - it is available in Australia only. This means that many migrants may not even be able to see it as their Google accounts are linked to their respective countries.,
Rod,26 April 2020,56,Working perfectly. Registration for the app started at 6pm sharp on Sunday 26 April, 2020. Sign up process was quick and easy, no issues at all. All those 1 star reviews are nonsense since they were trying to sign up before 6pm.,
Insert Name,28 April 2020,6,If you're going to make an app, please at least make sure to at least test it to make sure that everything is set to go before launching the app. It's been over a day now and my phone number is still invalid in your system. Please make an effort to fix this.,
wowee 10,27 April 2020,Fantastic app for keeping us safe, you can use a different name they said on the news, and it does not take your location only other covid users who have the app, and their phone number, easy simple to install.,
Sarjon Tomma,26 April 2020,11,

John Tumbridge,29 April 2020,2,I see the app as vital as many have said. My issue is that it is stopping my Bluetooth headphones from working. Very frustrating as I keep having to disable the app.,
Gareth Narunsky,7 May 2020,3,Since installing this app, every other Bluetooth use for my phone is no longer working. I can't listen to music on Bluetooth speaker without it constantly cutting out and I can't use hands free in my car.,
Mel McLean,15 May 2020,App downloaded and installed without any problems. Recently updated aswell. I have had zero issues using this app. Does not drain the battery, just sits in the background doing what its supposed to do.,
Peter Walker,15 May 2020,Installed app, other Bluetooth wouldn't work especially car connection . Uninstalled app other Bluetooth worked then installed app again and other Bluetooth again not working. Have uninstalled again and Bluetooth divices working again? Thought app didn't interfere with other Bluetooth connections,
David S,26 April 2020,7,Superb!!! Simple tech like this should be celebrated and championed. I saw someone mention somewhere that has been "opensource", if it is, and under the GPL, the absolute hats off to our government for doing the right thing!!! One thing I don't quite understand is that we're able to triangulate loca,
David Holliday,28 April 2020,I have tried to install this but cannot understand how you can get the pin number sent to the phone and still stay in the app. When it conmes to the part GET PIN you have to go out and when you log back in you lose that pin. I am confused, can some one help.,
Charlie Giuffre,27 April 2020,11,This app is not perfected, while talking on the phone the Bluetooth cut me off from talking three times I had to turn the Bluetooth off to continue uninterrupted. Disappointed with this app. Please find a fix.,
Melanie Hand,26 April 2020,229,All the 1 star reviews - don't give the app 1 star when the real problem is, you don't listen!!!! Registration will open at 6pm. Let's see how many reviews are changed to 5 stars when you get that message that you need to be tested because the app has done its job, and somebody in your family doesn',
Paul Panayi,26 April 2020,2,Very simple to install. Just remember NOT to use the starting 0 when you enter your phone number because of the +61 format in the registration process and finally make sure you have Bluetooth ON so it keeps running in the background.,
Tijo Joseph,28 April 2020,2,Uses very little battery even with Bluetooth on all day! Even though it's running all day, for an entire day of usage, it uses even less battery than my ABC News app that I use just for an hour a day.,
Patricia Rhodes,26 April 2020,34,Just downloaded the app & registered, no problems, quick and easy! Don't forget when you enter yr mobile, because the +61 country code is there, DON'T enter the first 0 of yr phone number. Excited to be part of keeping this virus under control.,
graham schilling,27 April 2020,61,Some where, anywhere, the media, the app description or the PM just had to mention you couldn't register the app until 6pm EST 26 April. Would have eased a lot of initial bad impressions. For the love of me I can't figure out why it hit the app stores BEFORE the registration process was ready. FFS h,
Lucas Griffin,27 April 2020,1,I dont trust it with my data but... The techicaly experts havn't noticed anything out of the ordinary. There are already apps on my phone that take my data and don't tell me what happens with it, at least this one will help us.,
Christopher Harvey,26 April 2020,35,Took me 30 seconds to install. All done and easy. For everyone whinging about the government and other people tracking you, you may as well delete your Facebook, Twitter, Google, Instagram, YouTube, Uber, Camera and nearly everything else on your phone whilst you are at it. Wake up, they all track u,
Jon,28 April 2020,5,Not a good experience. The app constantly sends notifications so any time I want to quickly check my notifications I will see something but I then have to pay too much attention to see if it is something other than COVIDSafe.,
Jarrod Timms,26 April 2020,570,Please everyone download and use this app! Yes it currently has an issue on signup, which im sure will be resolved in a matter of hours. Please leave positive reviews so we dont discourage others from using the app. With it, we have a greater chance of beating this virus!,
Whitney May Williamson,26 April 2020,24,The app notifies me every few hours that it's 'scanning to keep me safe' and the notification can't be dismissed. The instructions say if I turn off the notifications I won't be notified if I come on close proximity to a confirmed case. It's pretty annoying.,
Eve Barnes,26 April 2020,75,As an IT professional, until the source is released our a security review it is my belief based on the Australian government record (remote assistance legislation) that this software contains a backdoor which *will* be exploitable by hackers to expose more information than we are told it collects. I,
Kristin Flett,30 April 2020,1,Chews through the battery very quickly. I've been on my phone for an hour and my battery is now 82% and it started at 100%. Never had my battery drain that quickly before. Fix it or I until it,
Junyan Qu,6 May 2020,1,Despite whether this app is actually working, it closed down itself every 30 mins even I have my Bluetooth always on and enabled all permissions it asked. is it just me or anyone else may have this issue?,
Matt,5 May 2020,2,Amazing how many people allow Google, Apple, Facebook etc to access data yet will not trust an app that has the ability to assist in saving lifes. Bluetooth battery usage in modern phones is minimal and this app has not affected battery life on my Sony Xperia XZ2.,
Anthony Godin,6 May 2020,1,If I helps speed the new normality up, then all should use it. If it is privacy people worry about, there is more tracking in things like Maps and Facebook, Viber, WhatsApp etc The source is to be made available, making it transparent like Android itself. Let's all work together to keep all safe as,
Andrew McGrath,8 May 2020,Good app! Useful. Just one point - there is a type under "I want to Help" page. In the thirda paragraph it says "State ot territory", which should be "State or territory". Just from quality check perspective, no issues as such. Great effort by the government.,
Megan Jeffs,13 May 2020,Having to have Bluetooth always on is draining my battery, it is also telling me to turn battery optimisation on when it already is on. Will be deleting as I am not confident in its effectiveness yet.,
Mo Maureen Hunt,20 May 2020,Keeps me updated on what's happening with the virus but, fortunately, I have not come into contact with anybody who's tested positive so cannot comment further as to how it would work should that happen.,
Yancey L,27 April 2020,3,Said my phone number is invalid. So thats clearly a problem. Uninstalled it, reinstated it, same problem. Tried again 4 hours later (7pm) and I'm still invalid. Read the reviews, looks like 50% of the users are having the same problem.,
Harry More,26 April 2020,38,Seemless registration process (downloaded and registered after 6pm). Excellent explanation of how the app works with links to privacy policies and explanations of the protections in place. Requires location enabled in order for Bluetooth to work properly on Android.,
Averil Greenhalgh,26 April 2020,20,Come on, they did say after 6PM, so come back in a little while and try again. Everyone has exactly the same problem so let them have a bit of time to fix it. There is possibly 1 or 2 million of us trying to sign up all at the same time.,
Catherine Barton,28 April 2020,2,Had trouble trying to get 6 digit number. Kept saying my number was "Invalid" After making sure Bluetooth, location & battery optimizer was ok & installed & uninstalled, turned phone off & on.....Bloody nora, it worked. What a load of ka-buffle to put it nicely. ü§Øüò≥üò©ü•¥,
Lynne McKay,26 April 2020,8,Very easy and quick to install. For those having trouble with their phone number, you always need to drop the 0 before your mobile number when it follows the country code (+61 for Australia). So nothing wrong with the app!,
Bruce,27 April 2020,2,Good idea but poorly designed. 1: Battery usage question and selection descriptions are ambiguous. 2: Should recognize stable "home" location and switch off Bluetooth until required by a change of geolocation or status. 3: Released prior to accepting registrations - dumb,
Don O'Brien,29 April 2020,2,For Oppo users, you will need to change your COVIDSafe Background Running settings from "Smart Restriction of Background Running (Recommended)" to "Allow Background Running" This setting is found at Settings > App Management > COVIDSafe > Power Saver Other users may have similar settings,
Mitchell Starrenburg,26 April 2020,2,Registrations are now open, only took a minute. Poor form on the developers part for the misleading "Invalid Number" error message while registrations were still closed; caused a lot of unnecessary confusion.,
Alison Anderson,26 April 2020,55,I'd like to be able to use this app. However, I can't get the verification PIN because I have no mobile signal where I live. And we're not supposed to go out. Surely some other method of verification could be available for others in the same situation, as I'm sure I'm not the only one in Australia w,
Sue Fuller,28 April 2020,The app initially told me my number was invalid, on April 27. Now there is a notification saying "Restart phone if this notification..". unable to read rest of msg. Is this notification common & is it a problem. ?,
Ingrid Gollan,29 April 2020,Also had issues on Android with mobile phone number invalid even with Wi-Fi turned off and Bluetooth turned on. Persevered and tried again whilst phone connected to Bluetooth device, no problem.,
qwerty ytrewq,29 April 2020,2,Cant get a pin to verify my mobile ph no. Error message: invalid phone number. Tried with and without 0 before the other numbers. Cant proceed. Stupid product. Developed in haste. Dont get these monkeys to write the code for your space mission to Mars, your space craft will blow up on the way to the,
Chris Leach,1 May 2020,2,Great idea. Wanted badly to support it, but it has stopped me from answering my phone when it rings. I can't swipe my screen to answer calls so I have had to uninstall. Sony xz2,
Liz Carr,5 May 2020,The app does not recognise that power saving has been switched off on an Oppo R11s. Even after restarting with the power saver off it will not recognise it being off, as a result the app is not functional.,
cnt barry,8 May 2020,The only thing i have herd everyone complain about is the constant notification so just do an update and get rid of it. Spoken to heaps of people that deleted it after day because of a notification that doesn't need to be there.,
Gavin May,14 May 2020,Great app! Doing some good! It would be really good if the app provided constant news on the pandemic and was a primary source of information for Australians. I think more people would download it!,
John Stone,19 May 2020,1,Waste of time. The app won't send a pin to my phone. I've checked the help section and none are the reason why it won't work. Even uninstalled and reinstalled the app.,
Tony Devine,27 April 2020,4,Have installed the app after downloading "The Coronavirus Contact App Faqs" where it stated the location will not be recorded. WHY THEN IS IT A REQUIREMENT FOR YOU TO ALLOW LOCATION PERMISSIONS WHEN IT IS INSTALLED? Also in the HELP section when the app is open it states LOCATION INFO WILL NOT BE CO,
Gavin Matanis,26 April 2020,7,Not a big fan of the notification being there constantly and not being able to paste in the confirmation code was a UX faux pas. Otherwise I am hopeful this app can help get us back to some normality.,
Voytek Eymont,10 May 2020,Problem on Moto 3G, generally, it seems to work ok, but, on two or three occasions it goes haywire, it comes up with a modal popup "Unfortunately Bluetooth share has stopped" The popup keeps poping up faster than I can OK it.,
Greg Pearce,26 April 2020,7,Great app, hopefully the tin-foil hat wearing Barnaby's of the world will see the benefit for the greater good. One suggestion though, remove the constant 'CovoidSafe is scanning..' from the notification shade, it's annoying.,
Lara Connolly,27 April 2020,I think it's great. Feels more secure than most other apps I have on my phone as it doesn't ask permission for everything. Hopefully most download it and it can work to keep us safe!,
Chris Barnes,28 April 2020,Installation and registration worked OK, but the app won't stay running. It starts, the sticky notification is there, but an hour later it's just quietly stopped for no apparent reason.,
Zig Zag Wanderer,27 April 2020,1,Great idea. Does NOT need location data, it just uses Bluetooth to check other phones nearby. Especially good for those who do not have location data and internet access on all the time. Do it to let us all beat this silly hostage crisis!,
Jonathan L,26 April 2020,46,I wasn't able to get my six digit PIN. I tried again an hour later and the app said my phone number was invalid, yet the app managed to sniff out my number somehow and automatically display my number. Perhaps it's being sorted by the IT guys who are busily working on it.,
Kishor Varsani,26 April 2020,22,Quick and easy to install. Anything that protects me, my family, friends and the community is worth having. To those who are worried about privacy etc, remember facebook, whatsapp, tiktok and most other apps hold and share far more information about you, yet you use and upload everything about yours,
Imesh Kulasinghe,26 April 2020,5,Registration was very easy . Most negative rating are due to number been invalid. I got the same error the first time because after +61 I dropped the starting zero . Just ignore the +61, type your phone number starting with 04++++++++.,
Gabriela M,27 April 2020,2,If you get the invalid number message just turn off your WiFi, it seems to work that way. Hoping this gets fixed asap as it will stop many people from registering.,
Ty,27 April 2020,6,Interferes with medical equipment. Installed app and app started to interfere with the communication between my insulin pump and CGM blood sugars are now dangerously high, posisble hospital admision if i cant get BG's under control. Will not be using this app, untill this is resolved,
Matt Allcock,28 April 2020,Tried to out my mobile phone number in, (yes, with and without the zero), however it says that my phone number is invalid. Cannot get past that step, no matter how many times I retry.,
Thi Nguyen,26 April 2020,1,Downloaded, registered and now leaving it running in the background to keep me and my fellow Australians Covid safe. Pleasantly surprised how little personal data it collected, and how how little control of the phone it requires.,
Imar Mendoza,29 April 2020,1,Works now... I mean the registration... Concerned about battery life because seems to work in the foreground... After a couple of days, it definitely reduces battery life. Ok you got to do a better version...,
Walter Kaeding,7 May 2020,4,Make it available for android 5 and below. Help the older people to stay save too. Our Oppo phones are only 3.5 years old, but have android 5.1.1. I would have to root the phones to upgrade to 6 or better. Wouldn't take that chance it might brick the phones. These Oppo phones are excellent for every,
Michelle Harper,1 May 2020,1,Great idea but the app closes down when I turn my phone off and doesn't start up again when turning phone back on so I have to remember to turn the app back on and I have often forgotten so I'm out and about without the app being active,
RIck HIll,6 May 2020,4,App is useless for me, start the app, make sure it's working leave phone for 5 minutes, look again and app is closed, happens over and over again, my phone is only 12 months old,
Jill L,4 May 2020,Very easy to install. No need to have notifications on screen, just in the banner. If you can't download, ask your family or friends and help to keep your loved ones safe by having the app. Let's do this together to get back to normal life.,
Tanya Harich,27 April 2020,3,Downloaded fine but every time I try to register I get to the 'enter your mobile' section and request the pin only to be told it's an invalid number. I cant see anything in FAQs or a way to report this error other then here.,
Adam Brokes,27 April 2020,3,The app is from design and architectural perspective very good considering the amount of time the government had. Do I really want to have this app installed? No, not really. Will I install it if there is even a faint chance it might save somebody's health? Any day, anytime.,
Ian Leishman,26 April 2020,2,Worked straight away, registration process worked even before 6pm on 26/04/20. Endorsed by Medical professionals, doesn't use GPS, the protection to myself from others who may get sick and having an early warning for contact tracing weighs heavily for my favour than big brother paranoia.,
Matthew Brown,26 April 2020,10,Yes... Android needs to use location services along with Bluetooth for the app to work. No... It's not a govt conspiracy or that we've been lied to. You'll have to buy an Apple if you don't want to use location services,
Alison Fairleigh,26 April 2020,2,This is such a wonderful initiative. It was fast and easy to register, and now the app is working silently in the background to help protect me and my community. Contact tracing is absolutely necessary for the containment of this virus. Thank you!,
Monique Huffa,27 April 2020,Amazing idea but it won't let me sign up! Keeps saying my phone number is invalid so it won't text me the pin, even though I know my phone number is valid because I've been receiving calls on it. Any ideas?,
Alan Chng,26 April 2020,1,Installed and registered ok. Stay safe people. App run in the background. Data seems stored local as there is a function to "upload data when asked by health official." Not sure how much it will draining the battery yet.,
Mick Tterfmop,28 April 2020,Installed no issue on mine, but my wife's kept saying invalid phone number. But when i turned the wifi off on her phone and only used mobile data it installed no problem, so must be some issue with wifi causing the invalid phone number.,
kayla edmiston,28 April 2020,3,

Janeen Bates,28 April 2020,1,Very good customer service. I had trouble with my phone number being recognised in the registration process.They suggested to turn off wifi and try again and it worked!!!,
David Grocke,26 April 2020,2,Why is there even a rating for this app? The comments here are not helpful. This app has taught me how to love again! Let us hope when the little pockets of outbreaks continue to happen that this assists us not being locked down as much as today! Signup is seamless across my families devices. Let's,
Isabella Bain,26 April 2020,50,You should launch the app with out being able to register. Not everyone watches and reads the news and would know it will work after 6pm tonight. Error is, we can not add a mobile number and get the OTP as it says it is invalid. You should havehad a pop up/alert message at the start notifying this.,
Simon Bell,26 April 2020,1,Despite earlier reviews from people trying to register before the process was open this app is seamless. Easy to register, easy to use. Set, forget and protect yourself and those close to you.,
Mark Stubbs,27 April 2020,Very easy to install, not sure why some users are having difficulty with the phone number, it accepted mine straight away (with leading zero). Maybe you need to have your number registered on myGov?,
Dave Briskham,28 April 2020,1,No problem with installation or registration. Don't worry about security issues. The government has plenty of other ways to keep tabs on you. Thanks for keeping Australians safe.,
Matt Vickers,29 April 2020,1,Super easy to install. Appears to be working just fine with no hitches. A great initiative, the more people that download this the better our chances of achieving normality.,
Scott Davis,30 April 2020,Seems to be pretty unobtrusive to me, but my wife's phone is just a bit older and has Android 5 with no update pushed from Telstra. The initial version needs Android 6 or later.,
Jane Oldham,3 May 2020,1,I've signed up because it's the "right thing to do" but this thing slows data significantly, to the point where sites time out or return a "you are offline" result. Needs a lot of work.,
Nicole Gardner,1 May 2020,1,Constantly disconnects bluetooth headphones, starting to ask myself whether the app benefits outweighs the constant risk of my phone publically outing my addiction to early Brittney spears. Please fix this bug. Many of us STILL use Bluetooth around others (exercising, grocery shopping, essential pla,

I have an Oppo so maybe not compatible. Only did this to help every one get back to what ever normal will,
Peter Mingon,4 May 2020,1,I'm having the same issue regarding having to continuously approve the battery question. Both our phones are doing the same thing. Time for an update. REMOVE THE BATTERY QUESTION? üòÄ,
Linda Deys,4 May 2020,1,Well I've tried twice. Uninstalling for good now. It continuously turns off my Bluetooth even though I chose not to worry about battery life. And I hear on the news it isn't even turned on anyway!!,
Michael O'Brien,6 May 2020,3,I have a Nokia6 smartphone. App downloads; but, after several attempts to generate a PIN (after doing all suggestions like turn off WI-FI and input mobile number with or without the first zero) the APP never generates a PIN for me. Absolutely useless programming,
Rosalie,6 May 2020,3,Many phones are not compatible with this app! 3 out of 4 phones we tried to download this app are not compatible.....because they are too old! We have lost confidence in this app doing what's been promised to because not enough people will have it!,
R X,7 May 2020,4,New updates renders mire bugs to user. Persistent battery drain and bluetooth pairing totally wrecked. It has mutated to a different variant. Use antimalware and intrusion detection for permission allowed.,
James Clarke,10 May 2020,2,Installed no problem on S9, but I have a smart watch BT for tracking 24/7 in case of seizure when away from home & BT headset to make/receive calls, App disconnects headset or watch to handshake other phones all the time. Had to uninstall it.,
Angel Smith,12 May 2020,1,Doesnt drain my battery, everyone having a sook, I have a galaxy s10. Works fine. Doesn't drain the battery, and in fact I barely notice the app is there at all. Same data sharing as social media, so no brainer guys.,
CuteNinja101,15 May 2020,It won't let me register. Keeps telling me my phone number isnt valid. We have checked several times and all fields are filled with no. in 10 digit form.,
Jamie Munns,26 April 2020,30,Be Patient It's great that this app is in big demand as frustrating as signing up is. I think it will take a few days before demand settles down. I'm happy to do what it takes to sign up and help my fellow Aussies, i hope you are too.,
Karin Jorgensen,27 April 2020,Easy to install. The sooner everyone installs the sooner we can get some normality back and safeguard lives. Permissions needed and info requested is minimal compared to a lot of other online activity so shelve the paranoia and get on board.,
Pete Campbell,26 April 2020,2,That was probably the easiest App ever to install. Remember to drop the first 0 off your mobile number. If this saves one life it is worth it! Sure it uses data but so does every App and Storecard. Let's beat this virus together Australia!,
Adam Thompson,26 April 2020,Simple and safe, uses Bluetooth not GPS so nobody can know where you've been, only if you've been in Bluetooth connection for 15 minutes with someone who is contagious.,
Jacinta Cox,28 April 2020,3,Constantly causing other Bluetooth functions to stop working. If using Bluetooth speakers or headphones audio will cut out due to app doing a scan. App now deleted. Caused far too much interference with other Bluetooth functions,
Baxter Archer,27 April 2020,Annoying, it won't recognise my phone number, tried it every possible way without success. I was already on the fence on the privacy issue, now I'll just give up if it doesn't work,
Brad Irwin,15 May 2020,1,If the app is telling you your mobile number is invalid when you try to install, disconnect from WiFi internet connection, then type the number in again. Fixes the problem immediately.,
George Solomos,6 May 2020,1,Persistent notification is annoying but I understand the priority is keeping it running to keep the Bluetooth pinging. Reverse-engineering has shown the security of the app to be good but I hope the source is released soon.,
Giovanni Di Cello,27 April 2020,1,Just monitoring battery consumption but other than that no issues. Waiting for tin foil hatters to leave a review, frankly, to enjoy some nonsense. Maybe a "i am home" button to avoid battery strain would help?,
John Murray,27 April 2020,1,Simple to setup, then nothing else to do. Requires bluetooth to be on, leaves an annoying notification on lock screen to let you know it's still working.,
Magnus Erlendsson,26 April 2020,21,Easy to set up. I had no issues. If by downloading the app restrictions get lifted earlier I think it is worthwhile. Plus as the one who does the shopping I like the idea of knowing if I have been in contact with someone who has it.,
Grant Evans,27 April 2020,1,Registration pain. Won't register phone number unless wifi is off. PIN has to be entered as separate numbers, new one needed before trying to remember and type it in. Very frustrating.,
Tim Deverell,26 April 2020,2,Easy to download and set up. Anyone with privacy issues is clearly listening to to much ABC, every day we share way more of our privacy than this App will share and it will speed up our country returning to some semblance of normality.,
Andreas H,29 April 2020,Easy to install and register. I am running it since Sunday on a Pixel 3 and have not noticed a decrease in battery life or any other distribution to phone use. Recommended it all our staff.,
Sophia Halse,4 May 2020,Overall it's a very clever idea. Might still be useful after covid-19. Be good if 10 million ppl download it and the rest of the functions are completed so it can do what it was designed to do.,
Steven Nikolovski,10 May 2020,1,Hmm not sure about this app. Hate that it has a permanent notification. So annoying and pointless, just run in the background. Won't appear in the app store on my parents phone and they are elderly and need it. Once again, not good enough.,
Fozzy Foz,9 May 2020,1,Hardly noticed that it's running. No battery drain of a noticeable level and no slow downs. Some people report drop outs of other Bluetooth devices but I haven't noticed anything and I use a headset regularly.,
Derek White,8 May 2020,I have to disable it when on a phone call because I hear a ticking noise. When I disable this app the ticking sound stops. Using Samsung Galaxy Note 8. Android version 9.,
Melinda Londrigan,10 May 2020,I had to uninstall temporarily to use my skullcandy headphones as the Bluetooth kept cutting the music out, my husband didn't have the same problem with his Bose Bluetooth headphones, both using Samsung Galaxy S9.,
Jacob Brinkworth,15 May 2020,Great idea but eats up my phone's battery like no tomorrow, which considering its point is to somewhat monitor someone's surroundings, it's a pretty big deal if it eats up your battery life as a dead phone won't keep anyone safe.,
Michael Coppa,26 April 2020,4,Great app. Easy to set up. If you're worried about privacy, you already have Google and Apple apps that violate it. No point using privacy as an excuse for not getting this app.,
barney flint,26 April 2020,36,While I understand, and endorse the spirit, the implementation is flawed 1. It asks to grab location data - er - what? 2. It displays a constant notification, which you can only get rid of if you disable notifications for it - WHICH DEFEATS THE POINT OF THE APP!,
Din,27 April 2020,1,Excellent initiative. Minimal information required to set it up, and seems to work without a fuss in the background. Privacy policy is sensible. Please install to protect each other from COVID-19!,
Michael McAulay,26 April 2020,10,After I put my mobile number in, the app said invalid number but 5 mins later the code was sent to my phone (there must be alot of people using the app). Then i clicked on my phone notification and gave app permission. Then the app was working.,
Bob Bogisich,26 April 2020,8,Registration is easy. For those complaining, didn't you read that you need to register after 6pm?? As for dropping the "0", that's the standard way of entering a mobile number using the international format. It's a wonder some can answer their phone!,
shan sitters,9 May 2020,1,Easy sign up and was happy to have it but had to uninstall as not working the battery approval keeps turning app off so then it doesn't work have heard other oppo phones are having trouble too please look at fixing as would really like to have it working properly as the idea is good,
Elizabeth B,28 April 2020,1,Failed to register my details because of 'Invalid phone number'. Why ? People call me on this number and it works. I tried 2 number formats - without and with leading 0. Both failed.,
lisakynaston,27 April 2020,1,Annoying notification stays at the top of the screen and in drop down menu all the time cannot be removed. Uses too much battery for my liking.,
Bonnie Glendon,28 April 2020,2,I have the app on my samsung and it won't give me the pin number as it says my mobile number is invalid. Seeing it has the 61+ in front of the box I leave the 0 off but still says invalid mobile number with or without the 0. Can anyone help me with this.,
Steve D,26 April 2020,1,Phone number registration is active and working now (6pm Sunday). I don't like that it needs Location permission for it to be active and works properly (though GPS location is not required to be turned on),
Jacob Lovett,27 April 2020,It's irritating, because you want to do the right thing - but I don't leave my Bluetooth on 24/7. Not for battery reasons but multiple different connectivity reasons. So this is super frustrating. Use my location instead of Bluetooth. üòÇ,
Gordon Smith,28 April 2020,Very frustrating to download as could not register. Stuck at message "invalid phone number". After much searching found a suggestion to turn on data instead of WiFi, which worked. Needs more guidance on the app or help page,
Rudo Makuyana,28 April 2020,2,The app is interfering with my Bluetooth connectivity to other devices. In particular my Samsung Buds, is there an update to resolve this. I can't use the app if this keeps happening,
Raymond White,27 April 2020,2,Sadly after 8 attempts this app will not accept my mobile phone number that I have held for 39 years. That's right 39 yrs and as a result I will not be able to use this app. Therefore it will get deleted from my phone.,
Theo Kalkandis,27 April 2020,1,No problems installing but it absolutely chews through battery. New S10+ used to last a full day. I head to charge it at midday just to use the rest off the day. Once again down to 40% after only 3 hours.,
Kevin Francis,29 April 2020,Great app, great experience especially considering how quickly it was completed. I'm an IT expert and I consider it to be safe to use. Please listen to the experts and download.,
Adrian Attard,2 May 2020,App seems to work fine. Had no issues setting up. Doing my bit to help our country get back on its feet, reduce wait for easing the lockdown restrictions, and get people back into employment/work. Together we can reduce the impact that Covid-19 has on all of us.,
Kangaroo Inn - Innkeeper,2 May 2020,3,I use a separate phone for exercising and I notice the app cuts of the music streaming through my bluetooth headset every few moments. Its an older phone so I think the app places pressure on the phones BT cpu,
Peter Vincent,3 May 2020,1,Successfully installed on one phone - all good. Wanted to install on second phone but PlayStore only shows a similar app from the WHO and not this Australian one. There is no choice, just a blue one from the WHO. I do not want anything to do with the corrupt WHO or UN. I wonder how many people downl,
Paddles C,5 May 2020,1,The comments here are a case study in stupidity and selfishness. OK, Boomers: 1. It needs your location data because Android requires that setting to be on so Bluetooth can be activated. 2. So what if it uses up your battery life a little faster? Is recharging your phone slightly more often such a b,
Ruben _,17 May 2020,Severely disrupts my Bluetooth connection with speakers, headphones, etc. So when I'm playing music on my phone and the app is active, the music skips.,
Andy Hanoi,27 April 2020,1,I like how it doesn't assume you have (or want) internet access and geolocation turned on, and I can keep those turned off to maximise privacy from every other (often uninstallable) personal data hungry app on the phone.,
Joanna Does,27 April 2020,2,I'm happy to download it but when I try to register it says my ph number is invalid. I've had the same number for over 10 years. I tried uninstalling & reinstalling. Tried dropping the first 0. No luck.,
mathew rushen,26 April 2020,915,Considering this app is in googles android its more privacy oriented than any commercial app on my phone lol. Doesnt ask for every permission under ther sun like google knows less about me than google. And i control its access. 1 star removed because it wants me to keep bluetooths on all the time wh,
Garth Snimmit,28 April 2020,Apparently my phone number is invalid and I did drop the zero then I tried with the zero and tried both ways multiply times. As other reviews have stated if your number is invalid wait a couple of hours then try again and it will work.,
Mark Stanley,26 April 2020,28,Great app. Can't wait until 6pm tonight when you can enter details to register. To all the people rating this one because you can't register your phone number, that's because the app is not available for registering until 6pm.,
Ob1,29 April 2020,I fixed the "invalid phone number" error by not using any digits or special characters in my name....go figure - an error about the phone number due to invalid characters in the name field on the prior screen.,
Traci Goode,26 April 2020,3,I thought at first the app didn't work because it wouldn't accept my phone number but after reading other review and after a bit of waiting I was able to register. Didn't know about the 6pm thing but good so far,
Paul M,26 April 2020,39,Allowing bluetooth is a great way to get your banking details stolen. A noble idea for virus tracking, but fraught with security issues. I downloaded only to review but did not complete the install. Go ahead and install with this in mind.,
Hazel Brown,27 April 2020,1,Easy to install, and my privacy concerns are answered. Data is encrypted on my phone and not shared unless I agree. If this helps Is reduce restrictions while keeping us safe, I'm happy.,
Sammy Hamadiya,27 April 2020,2,Invalid phone number message error. Regardless if you include a 0 before the number or not, once it says your phone number is invalid you are stuck. Also why include +61 in the number given that it is only for Australia.,
T W,29 April 2020,People download Facebook and Google without a second thought but wont download this. Location request is only for bluetooth program to work and does not track your location. Does not use your gps. Great idea. Please download so we can be free sooner.,
Anonymous User,3 May 2020,1,Will wait for all the bugs to be ironed out. I love the way it says to restart your phone if the notification disappears. If the notification disappears, so does the message to restart your phone, duh!,
Stephen Fulop,2 May 2020,I'm unable to sign up. Every time I get to the stage of the pin and I look it up on my phone the app starts the whole sign up process again. It's just ridiculous.,
Matthew Wilson,1 May 2020,1,Need this app, as we need to get back to normality. But it is causing interruptions on Bluetooth headphones , occurs every 1-2 minutes. Please fix,
Lucia Deiro,5 May 2020,Can't get past registration. Unable to get access pin, keeps saying "check internet connection" even though I have connection. Have tried using both 4G and wifi, no luck.,
Shandra Coppard,6 May 2020,COVID SAFE APP PROBLEM My partner cannot download the covid safe app as he has an overseas google account and when he tries to download it the response is "this item is not available in your country". He has an Australian sim card in his phone and is in Australia indefinitely. Google only allow you,
Laura Noble,19 May 2020,1,Bluetooth connectivity with car, earphones continues to disconnect since using the app. Please look at fixing this if you want people to use this. I use a Samsung s10.,
Anatacia Cabral,17 May 2020,1,It wouldn't stay active. It always deactivates every time my phone goes on lock screen. I have to always activate it. I hope they fix it soon.,
Mick Fallon,26 April 2020,2,Installed easily. As an IT person with a good understanding of cyber security, I am comfortable with using this app in the control of Coronavirus.,
Andrew Morrison,27 April 2020,2,I'm not keen on government tracking but this is probably the least worst way to help get the virus sorted. Main concern is the potential battery drain. Don't know how it'll affect the battery life,
Paul Lecky,28 April 2020,Can't register. The app won't accept our phone numbers. Dropped the leading zero and entered the rest of the number. Others in the family are having the same problem.,
John Youngman,27 April 2020,1,Bluetooth interferences. Continually cuts in over other blue tooth audio systems if streaming. Very frustrating. Force stopped app and interference stopped. Needs to be looked at or we may forget to start it again.,
Andrew Thomas,27 April 2020,2,Can't believe the amount of brain dead people who whinged "the app is broken" because they put their phone number in before registration was open. (When they clearly said don't register before 6pm 26apr). üôÉ easy quick simple app. Let's beat this pandemic.,
Pann Ei,27 April 2020,1,I couldn't sign up as it keeps saying that my phone number is invalid. So I couldn't get pin number to proceed registration. Could you please fix the error for this? Thank you.,
Amy Jonnes,27 April 2020,I've installed on the 27th, but doesnt accept my phone number? According to other reviews, this glitch was fixed last night..but it's not fixed for me. Why? Is there still issues?,
Matt Hilton,28 April 2020,2,Couple of days in and it's unobtrusive, no noticeable impact on battery life, and I assume just doing its thing. Rego was quick and simple. Let's end the lockdown.,
Shubham Gupta,26 April 2020,Very innovative approach to spread awareness, though the option of upload my data is misleading and should only be visible to people who are seeking help for symptoms.,
Thierry Masquilier,26 April 2020,4,It seems they were glitches at the beginning. It can be expected. Working all fine now, including phone registration...,
Michael Jacombs,29 April 2020,Easy to install. No intervention required once installed. HOWEVER battery usage since my wife and I installed it has been HUGE. Phones now only lasting about 6hours.,
Tim Holder,27 April 2020,2,Tried numerous times to register and do the right thing. It continuously says I have invalid phone number with or without the 0. As at 1900hrs WST 27/4. Might try again in a few weeks. So much for a tested product.,
Will Pearce,27 April 2020,App is not letting me register, reason being invalid mobile number. I've had number for 10 years under my name. Has anyone else had similar problem?,
Mr Dr,26 April 2020,Simple and easy to install. No issues with registration. 95% of the 1 star reviews tried to register before it opened.,
Martin Haggas,27 April 2020,1,Lightweight and reasonably unobtrusive. The persistent notification is mildly annoying and not entirely sure what purpose it serves, hence only 4 stars.,
Hussain Mohammed,27 April 2020,4,Had issues with registration but it finally worked. Have patience, this is not a commercial money making app. It's for our own safety and whole community benefit.,
Kim S Ly,26 April 2020,1,An excellent initiative. An app that can help us to have a better control of COVID-19 infections is always a helping hand to our magnificent doctors, nurses, medical staff and other frontline workers.,
Ashish Maheshwari,29 April 2020,4,App is working, but draining away a lot of battery in phone, forcing me to charge in the middle of the day. I have tried restarting as well, doesn't help.,
Tien Can,27 April 2020,For those are concerned abt their privacy, have you ever read thru a T&C of any app installed on your phone? Have u ever read T&C of any website that you browsed before? If not, why are you so easy to give away your personal info for those but too harsh for an app of your Goverment trying to protect,
Robert Durrant,26 April 2020,33,Can't register. Has a bug that won't allow you to enter your mobile number during registration. I've uninstalled it and moved on. Perhaps better testing. Doesn't build confidence in this app which is already pretty low.,
Michael Borisenko,26 April 2020,3,I understand the concerns about privacy, but as a software engineer I'm satisfied with the precautions taken in this app. Please install it and help end the pandemic sooner.,
Amanda Ekman,26 April 2020,Great, simple app. Initial teething issues have been fixed and all is working well. Great initiative and an excellent resource. Well done to the developers.,
Maureen Brunn,30 April 2020,2,Tried about five times this app is definitely NOT user friendly, it kept telling me my phn number was invalid... I gave up in the end. Tried to do the right thing, I cannot be the only one.,
Quinn Andrews,1 May 2020,The App seems to work fine but there is no way to tell if it's working. Maybe if you had a count of how many 15 minute contact you had a day you could see if it's working.,
Alisha Webb,4 May 2020,Have to remove it as it drains my battery. Fantastic idea and very important for all to have but the developers need to ensure it doesn't drain batteries. It drains my battery within 5 hours.,
Paul Gurn,3 May 2020,Everyone should use it BUT it absolutely devestates battery life. If you dont optimise it it will defeat the purpose as people will be walking around with phones off due to flat batteries or remove the app.,
Daniel Washburn,2 May 2020,1,No impact to phone operation. No battery drain. Bluetooth works fine with other accessories while this is on. Other than the icon, you wouldn't know it was on.,
Daniel Burgin,4 May 2020,3,Installed the app day one on a Samsung Galaxy S10. No problems to date, though It seems to use slightly more Battery; not enough to be concerned over though.,
Tracy Power,9 May 2020,1,It chews through the battery usage. Have to recharge through the day as well as at night. Other than that, it just sits there unobtrusively in the background.,
F Paul,13 May 2020,2,App keeps closing by itself after sometime (judging from disappearing logo on top of screen). There's some apps that seem to "deactivate" the app, but other times, still is a mystery.,
Tristan Hanslip,16 May 2020,Don't wish to see the Australian convid-19 safe symbol on my phone all the time. You know that annoying tick Australian symbol, let alone in the notification bar constantly. Hope in the next update you can remove that feature please!. Remove it!.,
Lawrence Glen,27 April 2020,1,Uninstalling- come on guys, Bluetooth always on and a permanent notification that can't be switched off? Fix those things and use wifi/gps/Bluetooth triangulation and maybe we will have faith in it.,
Gerard M,27 April 2020,4,Works perfectly. Don't be concerned about it asking for location. That's just an Android requirement for low powered Bluetooth scanning.,
Nihal Albuquerque,27 April 2020,Covid safe needs to recognizes the house you live in so it can turn of bluetooth and location so it doesn't drain the battery. it should be able tell if you're at home based on your home wifi connection.,
Alby Kramer,27 April 2020,Easy easy. Easy to install, eazy to register. Other than that, it works by itself. Only need to keep phone on and bluetooth on. No uploads till you are requested to upload by health authority.,
Rusty Chev,26 April 2020,Very easy to install. Really nothing else to do once installed. Good for Australia. The one star raters are clearly not to switched on to how apps work.,
Fil Kindblad,26 April 2020,2,Easy install and registration. It would be nice if we could remove the seemingly permanent notification, that is going to get tired.,
Aidan M,26 April 2020,32,After analyzing this app This app uses 2 separate GPS location requests also pulls wifi access point locations and verify them with the GPS requests to determine direct GPS coordinates Pics and proof can be provided Weres the source code you said you would release last week? , do not install this go,
Simon Leonard,27 April 2020,1,I'm concerned about the source for this not yet being published and the reports that only partial code may be released in a few weeks subject to security officials approval. It could so easily be done in a private way. I'll consider reinstalling once I can read the source.,
Ken Parker,26 April 2020,11,Installed a few hours ago but was able to get PIN and activate at 5.05 pm ACST, live in SA. Give the govt. a chance, they've been pretty well spot on, we ALL need this app to work and that means a fantastic take up rate, let's go for at least 75%+.,
Joe Hovel,27 April 2020,2,So far so good. Looks straightforward and may save an enormous amount of time and effort to trace community infection. Privacy risks are very very low.,
Van Vincent Casipong,17 May 2020,Those Google accounts that had initially been setup from overseas are not able to download the app, though the users are located here in Australia. Please remove the restrictions.,
Lynnette Parsonson,26 April 2020,No issues registering. Worth having if it means saving lives, Australia is able to regain some semblance of normality, and a restart to our economy.,
Christopher H,26 April 2020,8,Installed successfully. Give this app a chance people. Don't take any notice of the mainstream media who seem intent on sabotaging it with negativity right from the start. We need it, every little bit helps.,
Alvin Lee,27 April 2020,It finally works and accepts my phone number. What happened in the last 30mins? We are all trying to help here but it puts people off when you want us all to download app but it does not even let you set it up properly the first time.,
Julian Lunn,27 April 2020,1,What would be good is a daily or weekly graph of how many people I am having 15 mins face to face contact with. This would give us an incentive to reduce our exposure. Works fine. Doesn't seem to affect the phones performance.,
Williamkinwah Lai,27 April 2020,1,How come the app NOT accepting my mobile phone number(dropping the leading 0). The same valid number i have been using over the past 10 years!!!. Frustration FRUSTRATION...... HEAPS..... PLEASE FIX THIS GATEWAY.... AL,
Adrienne Farrelly,27 April 2020,1,Thank you for making registration so quick and easy to follow. I'm not very tech savy so glad they made this simple, especially for elderly and vulnerable to follow. Let's hope this is a great additional tool to the fight against COVID 19. Cudos to all who developed this. Say home and save lives. Go,
shami sivan,27 April 2020,1,Great initiative by the govt. If you like the govt or not it's your pov. But this app helps in contact tracing and will keep us alive. People who are too concerned about privacy issues, stop using all the social media and then talk about privacy.,
Samantha Politi,28 April 2020,2,I think it's a great idea and the app works perfectly fine......I highly recommend that everyone downloads it because at the end of the day wouldn't you like to know if you have come in close contact with someone that has the Coronavirus.,
Stephen Young,27 April 2020,1,Setup did not work at first but all working now. This app is the first demonstration that government can respect privacy while building a suitable product.,
Michael Barker,27 April 2020,1,I have tried to load my mobile number to get a PIN but it won't accept the number, neither in +61 040... form or +61 40... form so it won't send me a PIN via text to confirm. Am using the phone of that mobile number too.,
Bernie Atkinson,27 April 2020,Hopeless tried to register but app kept on telling me my phone number was invalid. I have had the same number for 20 years so have no idea why this app wrong accept. Gave it 1 star because zero wasn't an option,
John Locandro,30 April 2020,1,Works fine but really hate being hounded to turn when I am at home and there is no possibility of catching Covid. It does drain battery faster so enough of the hounding already. Apart from this it's fine,
Daniel Borin,3 May 2020,Minimal info required to get setup. Has worked solidly for days since installation. Seems to have had minimal to no impact on battery life.,
Prashant,4 May 2020,When i enter my phone number to register it pops up a error message saying - please try again. I've been trying this for last 2 days, rebooted my phone but no luck,
Sharlene Welden,4 May 2020,App seems fine except for the constant notification that I need to restart my phone if I see the notification. Re-start and the damn thing pops up again!,
SP,13 May 2020,3,Needs to be more compatible with older device. Drains the battery, my phone is about 3+ years old. Keep bluetooth off unless I leave the house. Easy to install.,
Chris Henry,6 May 2020,1,Surprisingly good. Uses bugger all battery, doesn't interfere with other bluetooth devices. The permanent message is annoying but I have that for my smart watch already so I'm used to it.,
Happy Days,13 May 2020,This app keeps inactivating, saying battery is not running in the background even when i allow it to. How is it ment to be useful, very temperamental.. and i have to keep checking it and turning on the permissions.,
Mick Dick,26 April 2020,Great idea & was easy to install. Only concern is that hopefully bluetooth constantly on doesnt drain the battery too much? Time will tell.,
Mark Price,27 April 2020,1,All good now, gave up trying on the first few hours but the next day it has installed OK. Hope this helps manage Covid-19 and get us back to normal as fast as possible.,
Nic Robb,4 May 2020,17,I'm for a tracing app; great idea. Initially thought Bluetooth was killing my battery life, but it's not. I don't even notice is there after running it for a week,
Tracey Dowswell,28 April 2020,Won't accept phone number. Maybe you need to do an update. Tried 4 times and keep getting invalid number for my mobile. Not just happening for me but for other people I know too,
Paridhi,27 April 2020,1,An awesome step taken by the Australian government. This app got installed with no issues, easy to understand interface and guidelines. I urge all Australians to download it and use it.,
John Roberson,26 April 2020,23,Great app. It gives me a level of confidence that we can stay on top of Covid-19. It should be used by all who leave lock down conditions as a measure of protection for all.,
G Amato,27 April 2020,Very easy to navigate , this app asks for very little personal info , it is less intrusive than an app download from Google or most social media sites , if this helps keep my self my family and others safe I am more than happy to use it .,
Julie Green,26 April 2020,2,Works, easy to install, clearly works in background (has a little symbol at top to show it's working) Read FAQs on website if you have any questions,
Roinic Dukat,28 April 2020,Yes it's anonymous and encrypted! It only asks for your number. If by accident you come into close contact with someone who was affected, the health dept. will call you. That's it. It's a great tool. Download it, so we can be done with this.,
Di Carter,27 April 2020,1,Won't even let me finish with registration, tells me my mobile number is invalid. It's not invalid when I have to pay the bill every month lol. Not sure what to do from here.,
Brett Worthington,27 April 2020,In principle I agree with the use of this app, choosing to use Bluetooth though just seems dated: it's easier to break into a Bluetooth connection and a general power drain.,
Geoff T,26 April 2020,38,Please note App can be downloaded, however, registration is from 6pm 26 April 2020. I think it is good to download ahead of registration opening. Be patient folks, help our vital workers and download. Its a small compromise to make for all our good health and those around us.,
Nina Monger,27 April 2020,1,I had trouble registering my phone number, the app said it was invalid. I disabled Wifi on my phone, just used my phone data instead, and was then able to register without any problems.,
Ausie IOT,26 April 2020,5,I was unable to complete the registration because I can't read the pin it sends during the registration, if you go to read the SMS, you have to restart the registration and get a new PIN, and go around the loop again.,
J Rezek,27 April 2020,Easy to install and setup, takes less than one minute and doesn't ask for endless permissions like most other apps. No issues reported by antispy apps PrivacyScanner or Incognito. Do this for Team Australia people!,
Beryl Irvine,27 April 2020,3,Keep getting "invalid phone number" Been trying for 24 hours, uninstaller and retried several times. Time they sorted this error out if they want to get the numbers to 40%. Very frustrating.,
Michael Daly,27 April 2020,1,Got a dual sim phone. Both numbers reported as 'invalid' when attempting installation. If this is because of excessive demand, why wasn't this anticipated by the software engineers? And an appropriate error message presented?,
Bec,28 April 2020,Great for newer phones HOWEVER, our daughter's phone is 3 years old and apparently the operating system is too old and so is not compatible with this app. Such a shame that she can't participate - we are all now unemployed and not in a position to upgrade her phone at this time. Does anyone know how,
Trudy Van Gestel,27 April 2020,3,Totally useless! Can't register because it won't accept my mobile number. Keeps telling me the number is invalid. Does the same on my husband's mobile. Just total frustration PLUS!!!,
Bernard Tan,27 April 2020,1,The registration process works flawlessly. The people who are giving it 1 star don't get area codes. If your still confused, just drop the Zero at the start of your number and put it in the app.,
Jerome Fink,28 April 2020,2,Easy to install, no negative effect on phone or battery life. Good rollout. Enjoying being part of a very large experiment. Hope the anti-vaxxers don't derail it.,
Carl Kenner,26 April 2020,10,Excellent. Very easy to use. There are no privacy issues. Everything is voluntary. Lets you know if you have come into contact with infected people. Highly recommended if you want to help with contact tracing in the event you get sick.,
Grant MacDonald,30 April 2020,1,Good idea, and works as expected. Given the amount of info I give Google, the minor privacy concerns are not bothering me.,
Eddie Saez,18 May 2020,2,NEEDS ON/OFF Feature .. No point having it on when I'm home with my wife and daughter it's just chewing up my battery for nothing.. Disabled the App and my battery usage went back normal.. definitely using way more than necessary.,
Robert Munnings,8 May 2020,App seems to work well with minimal intrusion and battery drain. I like how I can turn on aeroplane mode to reduce cellphone EMF exposure and keep Bluetooth on.,
elizabeth somers,10 May 2020,4,I really want to keep the COVID safe app on my phone but it's draining my battery so quickly now I have to keep my phone on charge all day. Not viable to keep the app on if I am going to be out all day - which is essentially when I need the app working....,
Perow Gourlay,20 May 2020,I will not install this app, it relies on Bluetooth & I will not leave my Bluetooth on risking my phone getting hacked via Bluetooth. Also as someone that suffers with social phobia, I use my phone's music player to help me keep stress & anxiety levels down when I go out.,
Donna Cam,27 April 2020,3,Thank you for the reviewer who noted - Wifi needs to be turned off in order for your phone number to be recognised when applying. (No more invalid phone number message - Hooray!),
Marco Patrizi,28 April 2020,Very well designed app, love it and its intent, no issues and uses only 0.5% battery past 3 days. 5***** from me all Aussies should install it.,
Megan Y,28 April 2020,1,Android 6.0 updated fully Samsung 5 unable to register invalid number. With and without zero. Open close Uninstalled reinstalled its 2am Tuesday it should not be busy. So how to use if cannot register,
Jac Hope,27 April 2020,I had difficulty registering at first but I turned my wifi off and it worked so if you are having problems that might be the cause.,
Fiona Yay,27 April 2020,Quick and easy to intall. Feel safer now that i can be notified if I come into contact with someone with covid 19 (who also has the app).,
Stella Smith,26 April 2020,3,Easy registration process. Leave off the 0 that is the first digit of your mobile number. Sad that it doesn't work on android 5 though. Only one of our family can register.,
Stephen Claydon,28 April 2020,2,I can't register, saying my phone number is invalid. Note: this is at 9:55pm on 27th Can anyone help ? O.k. the app finally registered at approx 12:09pm 28th April 2020. All good so far.,
Ian Bone,26 April 2020,Very easy to install and register. Explanation on Govt Website easy to read and understand making the decision to use very easy as well.,
Ry Martin,27 April 2020,Used only 2% battery in 24 hours. Good privacy model in only locally storing the information and you having to manual upload the deidentified data if you test positive.,
David Stevens,27 April 2020,A few hiccups to start with (I would say due to the mass amount of people downloading), but now works a treat!,
Chookasaurus,26 April 2020,Registration works now for those who tried to register before it officially launched. Also remove the leading zero on your mobile number when you register. +61 replaces the first 0 in your mobile number so it's +61 4xx xxx xxx,
mandy-lee whelan,27 April 2020,It keeps telling me my mobile phone number is invalid..... in which, I can't proceed to the next step.... I'm sure it will be a good app once these little things are fixed.,
Graeme Butler,27 April 2020,2,Installing the app requires Android OS 6 onward- so already facing the gap of many in the community having no mobiles- added to this you have to have a recent upgrade which is unrealistic on Android (the most widespread mobile OS),
Carla Roderick,28 April 2020,Both my son and I have tried to register this morning. We've dropped the 0 at the start of our mobile numbers. Can't get the pin number to proceed. Has this app crashed?,
Antony Thomas,26 April 2020,5,Good concept. But won't work if the battery saver option is on. Usually the battery saver option will be on in most of the mobiles. Need an option to disable the battery saver option as most of the users won't be knowing how to disable it.,
Alex Zaia,26 April 2020,25,I don't mind if it runs in the background, just let me hide the persistent notification. I don't need it to tell me it's running, I've already accepted the terms and agree to all the permissions.,
Mike S,27 April 2020,2,Installed it, does exactly what it says on the tin. Based on an open source product and not obfuscated, so nothing to hide either which is good.,
Jason Newman,27 April 2020,2,I would Give you more but it won't let me register it keeps telling me my number is invalid has anyone else had this problem could the developers please give me some tips I have left the zero off my mobile number but it still says it is so it won't let me proceed any further,
Maria Heta,26 April 2020,7,Installed at 6:15pm. Had no issues at all. Anyone having trouble entering phone number remember: +61 represents the 0 at the start of your number and so there's no need to enter it into the number box provided.,
Aiden Sobey,27 April 2020,1,They say they don't collect location, but then require location permissions..? Other than that I think they're being reasonable and upfront about the privacy implications of the app. Do your bit and install it,
Dianne Mullin,28 April 2020,It keeps telling me I have an "invalid phone number" and won't go any further. I've checked my data and it's correct. Why is this happening?,
John Bauer,29 April 2020,1,The theory behind the app is great, but it needs to work properly. The notification symbol my phone keeps disappearing, does this mean it's not on and working?,
Matt Caffrey,30 April 2020,2,It works and it is safe to use. Code looks clean and data stored securely. Well done to the programmer who took this on.,
Sean Kum,30 April 2020,Great, no issues installing and setting up. Don't have any problem in using it or privacy concerns. Google, Facebook & Apple have more of your data than this app!,
Heather Louise Dunn,4 May 2020,Pathetic. Getting the pin number managed to wipe out where the site bead to down load. Now will have to start again. Why isn't this made simpler?,
ArjaxLarjax,8 May 2020,Works fine, alot of people are having trouble with "Invalid Phone Number", I had this problem, and closing and reopening the app and re-entering it.,
Sanjay Patel,26 April 2020,2,People who are whining about privacy are biggest dumb on this planet, you are tracked while using your maps, phones even your TV / Facebook searches , drones or satellite can see you as well, deal with it and get out of it, Installing this App is not going to jeopardize any of your rights, it will h,
Tony Omes,28 April 2020,1,After running for over a full day there has been negligible drain on battery noticed. No permissions are requested for any service except Bluetooth.,
Daisy Wang,28 April 2020,2,Downloaded the app successfully. However, I'm unable to continue my registration using my mobile number. It keep saying invalid phone number after I enter my mobile number several times.,
Tristan Ashford,28 April 2020,2,Well done. I was concerned about having bluetooth draining my battery 24/7, but its been a really minuscule effect. Download and share!,
Dooghan Smith,26 April 2020,3,No problem with the app install. Registration was painless. The app needs less info them a lot of apps or websites I've signed up to.,
Vaga Bond,26 April 2020,Good. Clear privacy statements, simple onboarding, flexible (use real name or pseudonym). Also like that it configures my Android settings (bluetooth, battery, location) with one click for each.,
Timothy Reesink,26 April 2020,16,Great app that allows the Government to start reducing restrictions! Any privacy or data concerns have been carefully worked through to make this app entirely safe. It does not record your location.,
Anthony,26 April 2020,Great idea. Let's hope it works as intended and many people download it. Anything that gets restrictions eased sooner sounds good to me.,
Roger Gillard,28 April 2020,2,I had a glitch registering as I had Wi-Fi on, when i turned it off I got the SMS. Also is it possible to add an "at home" mode, I usually only turn on Bluetooth when I'm in the car etc?,
Jolly,27 April 2020,3,If you get an error saying your phone number is invalid, turn off Wi-Fi and just use mobile data to set up. Remember to leave the first 0 off your number.,
Jock Duncan,28 April 2020,1,Seems to work fine so far. Haven't noticed any large battery drain or other issues, which was my main concern with having this on all the time.,
Daniel Toohey,26 April 2020,Very quick and easy to install. And definitely more privacy oriented than most apps on my phone. Let's all keep looking after each other as we walk this path together.,
James Riesz,27 April 2020,Great initiative and good work getting it out nice and quickly. Works as described, easy to sign up and appears to consider privacy well.,
harry lenders,27 April 2020,Invalid phone number every time I try to install on my phone although over 1 million people have managed to install it After about 10 attempts it finally accepted my mobile number.,
Michael Yen,27 April 2020,Very easy to set up. Today, the app has been running on my phone in the background for more than 9 hours so far, and the battery usage is 0.7% according to the system.,
Peter Stagg,26 April 2020,8,Easy to register and clear information on the what the app will do for our community. While it's voluntary it makes sense the more people register the more info we shall have on the spread of the virus. That can only be a good thing for us as a community.,
Rebecca Miller,26 April 2020,6,If you use a virtual IP when you register, make sure it's set to Australia, as otherwise you may find the app won't send a verification PIN to your phone.,
The Wolf,26 April 2020,Easy install, phone number issue has been fixed, give this nothing but a 5 star rating as the more people using this the saver everyone is. If you have given a lower rating, please change it.,
Joy Phillips,26 April 2020,1,The registration and download process was simple. Thanks for creating this app and thanks so much to other Australians for downloading and helping to keep us all safe.,
Max W Klasse,27 April 2020,1,Good initiative. Easy to install and register; when it asks for your mobile number, don't enter the first 0 then registration would be a breeze.,
Melissa Pratt,27 April 2020,I'm trying to put my details in (a day or 2 after it launched) and its telling me my mobile number is invalid and its not, very frustrating.,
Kim Preston,26 April 2020,8,Registration issue resolved. The person who decided to launch and release the app but delay the ability to USE the app for several hours should be no where near this, or any other app though.,
Shayan M,26 April 2020,20,Can't sign up because it doesn't recognise my phone number as valid one. Are you serious, how do you miss something as basic as phone number field validation lol. If you had one person actually use the app prior to release, this wouldn't have happened..,
Antoine M,29 April 2020,Great idea but I couldn't register. Error indicates that my phone number is invalid after several attempts! Finally managed to register.,
Steve W,26 April 2020,4,Couldn't be easier to register. Used A pseudonym, and I don't like having my Bluetooth on all the time, but a small price to pay,
Martin Stonebridge,26 April 2020,12,App downloaded speedily and registration went smoothly. Disregard the people who gave a score of one. They tried registering before the registration process was ready. It's all working now.,
Standardbred Adventures,29 April 2020,Simple to install. Easy to register. Running smoothly. To the people with battery drain, put battery saver on.,
Alan Whyborn,1 May 2020,1,Ever since I installed the app my Bluetooth headset has had issues. The music keeps stopping, restarting, changing volume when I'm out (possibly linked to passing cars).,
Felicity Bing,4 May 2020,Bluetooth ALWAYS cuts out after 1 minute, no point having if I have to constantly reconnect manually, doesn't track movements accurately as a result.,
Trevor Payne,4 May 2020,The app causes Podcasts to keep freezing for a few seconds. When the app is Forced Stopped the Podcasts play OK. This needs to be fixed (phone is Samsung S9),
Marcus Richardson,6 May 2020,1,Repetitive push notifications are annoying, otherwise fine. The app and Bluetooth use bugger all battery. Apparently disabling notifications will disable the app... So my app is disabled,
Simon Cunningham,7 May 2020,1,Doesn't work if Google play is not set to the Australian region. Couple of child care workers who can't change the region (non technical reason) are unable to install to do the right thing.,
Faith Evans,10 May 2020,this app is great. it us helping keep us safe, so it remains downloaded on my phone. for all of the people complaining about their battery, it is not something that you should be prioritising right now.,
n j,18 May 2020,1,Unable to to install in my Huawei P40 pro. If the government cares about people it needs to ensure that its published in all the platforms. Huawei App Gallery is missing this app.,
Pete Sevenlewis,15 May 2020,We need this app to work. I've found it affects my Bluetooth streaming and my battery life. At least don't send us pointless copy and pasted FAQs.,
Elza James,26 April 2020,11,I downloaded it without problems. I put the 0 (zero) in front of my phone number despite the +61 and the PIN came through just fine. I had to delete 2 other apps to make space.,
Malcolm Russell,26 April 2020,1,Well written app. Easy to use and register. Permissions requested make sense. Hopefully initiatives like this will speed our return to free movement.,
Wendy Mcmullen,27 April 2020,1,Omg what the heck am I am doing wrong keeps saying invalid mobile number... so dropped the 0 plus as well as tried 04........ and keeps saying invalid mobile number can anyone assist me please....thanks ...read Jollys review of today...did what Jolly said and it worked...yeh,
Jessica Tilley,28 April 2020,1,Easy to install (drop the "0" from your phone number). Doesn't seem to waste battery. Haven't had my sock drawer raided by ASIO and my PornHub account is still working just fine.,
David Fromoz,27 April 2020,2,I would rather trust this app to remember who I've encountered than try to remember where I was on a certain day at a certain time. I would rather trust this app than depend on you to remember I was near you for 15 minutes at a certain place, on a certain day, at a certain time. This app is not trac,
Derek Harris,30 April 2020,5,Simple enough. Works ok in background. Not noticing any additional battery drain. Hope it helps us all.,
MarkErin R,27 April 2020,Tried installing the app. Had the 'invalid mobile number' error that others have had. Can't complete my registration which is frustrating.,
Corey Hanrahan,26 April 2020,Very clear description of privacy considerations. Easy to set up and well thought out design. Nice :),
ard de guzman,26 April 2020,43,Can't get past mobile verification. It says please try again later whenever I attempt to get a pin. Please ensure the has no bugs if you want people to participate. It's hard to cope with the crisis already don't add another one.,
David Gilbertson,26 April 2020,17,Registration was easy. Well done app, only sends data IF you become infected AND you consent to data being shared - hopefully something very few of us have to worry about. Please everyone install this app.,
Jonathan Couvaras,26 April 2020,Initially had registration issue (phone number invalid) but at the press release did say you can register from 6pm and since this time all has been working well....,
Ryan Hernandez,27 April 2020,1,The app works very transparently and the benefits outweigh any issues relating to battery usage or overheads. Savings lives by reducing contact timeframes is a goal that really should matter to everyone.,
Derek Geer,27 April 2020,On my phone running Android 8 definitely 5 stars. Wonderful idea and no security issues. However only 1 star rating as it won't load on my Wife's phone with Android 5 - and no chance of Samsung updating.,
Stephen Mellor,26 April 2020,61,Please stop rating this one star. I understand the registration process is not open yet and this is why some of you are experiencing errors. Your negative vote could impact the downloading of this app and in turn public health. Please think carefully before you vote.,
ChopperG,27 April 2020,1,Install and setup was a breeze. I installed it because the more people that use it, the more effective it will be. Be glad when it's not needed anymore though.,
Rawail Khan,27 April 2020,This app doesn't work, When I enter my mobile number it says invalid number. And the app keeps hanging on my brothers phone. I have a Samsung s10+ and he has an iPhone. Will this issue be fixed soon?,
Kerrie Russell,26 April 2020,Happy to be a part of the possible solution to the relaxation of some restrictions. We have to start somewhere. Easy to download. I have no concerns about privacy with this app whatsoever.,
Ingmar M,26 April 2020,You MUST remove the leading 0 from your number when registering. This should have been made clear so less tech folks don't encounter the invalid number error.,
Jessica Tomkins,27 April 2020,1,Love the idea of the app, very proactive. However unable to verify phone number after 6 p.m. - I am on a Android device. :),
Martyn Symes,28 April 2020,Downloaded, Installed and tried to sign up details but app failed to recognize my mobile phone number I have had for over 20 years. In turn, I got no further!!,
Zoe Hudson,27 April 2020,1,2 complaints: Why does it need location permissions if it runs off bluetooth? Please get rid of the notification saying it is running. Not necessary.,
Kadek Raheni,27 April 2020,I just downloaded the app ( 27 april at 18.50) but it didnt work when i put my phone number, it keep saying invalid number. Does anyone has same problem?,
Colin Hill,26 April 2020,Registered successfully first time. Not sure why others are whinging about the registration process. Be patient people; this could save your life and the life of those around you.,
Palebushman,27 April 2020,3,Bit silly the goverment promoting an app that fails in the registation process in order to make it functional. Nothing wrong with my phone number so the dysfunctional app has now been uninstalled!,
Cathal Crawford,27 April 2020,1,Doesn't work, I get the common 'invalid phone no' error, typical gov software screw-up, it's not that hard to develop a basic app that works,
Lauri Strengell,26 April 2020,1,If this app helps getting the community back on its feet, I'm all for it. As for security, Google has all my info already. And if anyone thinks the Government is spying on them, they may just overestimate their own importance, a bit! Let's switch the bluetooth on and get out of the house!,
Jon Lapitan,26 April 2020,2,App is fine. Simple sign up. Data stays on your phone till you decide to upload it. Records expire after 21 days.,
Nic DB,26 April 2020,3,Seems like, the system could not cope with demand, be patient and come back for another try. (Did not accept my phone number, said that it is invalid. All sorted now.),
Jonathon Alderman,27 April 2020,1,Super simple and works perfectly now. I couldn't initially register but problems were ironed out very early! Plenty of information on how it works too.,
Mohammed Jitarayah,26 April 2020,1,I think the way this app work and track is very professional, no location service will be used to track the places I visited, just other users who are close to me and using this app.,
gill Madhan,30 April 2020,This app is so important to protect our selves and our loved ones. I hope more people get this app. No problem with it. Doesn't drain my battery as some suggest.,
Wildwood Dryad,29 April 2020,1,I got to the stage with the PIN, but can't read it from message without minimising the app, which then resets, and needs a new PIN.,
Danielle Connor,3 May 2020,No fuss. Had this app a few days. No problems at all. Stop being a conspiracy theorist and install the app. Its a useful too to track human contact for Covid-19.,
Emily Slinger,3 May 2020,1,Quick, easy setup. Seems to be running in the background with no issues (Pixel 3).,
Amy Howie,1 May 2020,The permanent icon is a little annoying, but just like the software update notification you get used to ignoring it.,
Andrew Luecke,5 May 2020,1,He's not forcing us to install this of course.. He's just saying that it will affect the outcome of whether restrictions are loosened. Furthermore, we wouldn't even need this if we went for elimination, which we should do. This does not fix the problem entirely. And they didn't release source code a,
daniel Rossini,4 May 2020,Downloaded the app. But despite having the same phone number for 15 years when I try to register it says my phone number is invalid.,
Rhys Green,4 May 2020,2,Working for the government they tell you to turn your BT off when not in use, yet they've released an app that doesn't work unless its on? Seems like they are creating security risks in or to gain access to our info.,
Suzanne Reid,4 May 2020,This was meant to be only a few steps. Am I missing something? I habe put in the verification number and still asking to put in again. Will try one more time then if no response I will forget.,
Ashley Lord,6 May 2020,3,Unfortunately, due to the overly aggressive battery optimisation built into Oppo phones which users have little control, this app gets forced closed within minutes.,
Magenta Southgate,10 May 2020,1,Works pretty well. Would prefer it if the symbol would go away from the top of the phone. Type A's hate that. Considering deleting it to get rid of the icon.,
sydneystargazers,20 May 2020,This is an app everyone in Australia needs to have on their phone. If a vaccine is discovered in the next 12 months it will take a long time to vaccinate the 7.8 billion people on the planet.... so please don't assume the virus will be gone in 6 months. Download the app so you know if you may have b,
Adam Myles,20 May 2020,1,Waste of time. The app doesn't work it continually turns itself off telling you that its your battery optimisation, typical of this government really half-baked and useless!,
Richard Raynham,20 May 2020,1,Everytime the application does a scan or update it disturbs the sound (music) being run by other applications. Seriously annoying.,
Andrew Doyle,26 April 2020,2,Such a great initiative from the government to help slow the spread of this virus. Was easy to register and the privacy policy clearly explains how the data is stored.,
Roble Abdikarin,26 April 2020,1,I guess it consumes alot of battery but that doesn't matter now as long as downloading the app saves lifes and making easy to track people who close contact confirmed cases.,
robert law,27 April 2020,1,Downloaded easily but now phone says "connected to null" then "disconnected from null" continuously.... very annoying. NEXT DAY....uninstalled app then re-installed, annoying "null" messages have disappeared (hopefully). App now gets 4 stars frm me.,
Marcia ALLEN,29 April 2020,1,Very happy SUGGESTION - Can you have something to let it know I'm at home because the Only problem is it uses a lot of battery SO - I'm turning Bluetooth off while at home & will turn it back on when I go out This will END LOCKDOWN GPS access not stored,
Dan Power,27 April 2020,3,I tried to load the app on my wife's phone but it said it was not compatiable. Her phone is about 5 years old and she has no plans on upgrading as it still works fine so she won't be able to participate.,
Sandy Crombie,28 April 2020,1,Am stil unable to complete registration....I have uninstalled & reinstalled a number of times but cant complete each time I try to do my phone number it says "Invalid Phone Number" & that is using the 0 or leaving it off,
Michael Lyons,27 April 2020,1,Tried unsuccessfully for three hours to register and all I got repeatedly was an invalid mobile phone number - and I can assure you, it's a valid number.,
John Hilton,26 April 2020,1,Easy to install, easy to register. If it help us get back to normal quicker, I'm all for it. They are very clear as to how the data is kept and when it will be accessed,
Chris Smith,29 April 2020,Simple to install and setup. Unobtrusive. After running it for a few days I'm not seeing any real hit on battery life.,
Ben Walsh,27 April 2020,1,Simple install and registration. Wants to know less about me than Facebook. Putting that data to much better use. I hope enough people get on board so we can start to claw our way back to normal,
terrance murphy,27 April 2020,7,App requires use of Bluetooth so others with the app can be notified someone else nearby can be alerted. Big security risk for users as phones can be hacked by an enabled Bluetooth regardless if it's visible or hidden. Do not install if you don't want your phone hacked,
Lachlan Slade,27 April 2020,4,Ive had the same message 3 times saying that I need to restart my phone. Surely this can't be right, please fix it.,
Daniel Colliver,27 April 2020,3,Easy to register and was pretty straight forward with how its supposed to work. Hope it makes a difference.,
James,27 April 2020,It's working and I'll keep it on there a little bit longer but the battery drain is probably about an extra 30% daily on my phone.,
Sanket Meghani,27 April 2020,1,Excellent step by Australian Health Department. Quite easy to register and designed keeping in mind privacy of Individuals. Thank you Australian Health Department for the app.,
John De Freitas,27 April 2020,If it keep people safe why not. I wouldn't be worried about tracking. There alot of other app that do this more eg google, what app, facebook etc.. with here own hidden agenda's.,
Sandra Wilson,28 April 2020,1,I cant type in my number even if i do drop the 0 at the start. I've uninstalled the app and then down loaded again. Still cant do it. Its a new mobile phone . So very up to date.,
Christopher Beggs,29 April 2020,3,Causes other Bluetooth devices (eg speakers) to glitch and drop out. Have tested with and without this app running - it's definitely causing some kind of issue.,
Bindoon Bogan,29 April 2020,Difficulty registering my phone number at first (probably due to traffic). Closed it and tried again later no problem. Works fine,
Karen White,12 May 2020,1,Easy as to install. But doesn't stay on. Something to do with battery optimisation, even though I've turned it off in my settings. Android.,
Shirley Ryce,4 May 2020,Have tried to register my phone and it's rejected each time. My number is not recognised. So I can't receive a pin no.,
Jacob Heard,6 May 2020,Good premise... But since installing my phone has slowed right down. Cuts out other apps and disrupts Bluetooth connections with other devices.,
Steve,17 May 2020,Have son with diabetes so installed but it is a battery hog. Disable bluetooth while at home. Battery usage showed 47% usage was by this app while all other apps negligable.,
baggi sandhu,14 May 2020,Installed it. And now my phone won't send files to my laptop via Bluetooth. Have to connect cables. Again. Please fix,
Girish Ranade,26 April 2020,It's looking good and easy to use / install, in current condition, looking rest of the countries, it's better to stay safe and help each other.,
P J,27 April 2020,1,Please remove it from the notification tray it is annoying, the small symbol above like wifi bluetooth ect is fine. Happy to help fellow Aussies. 5 stars if that is fixed.,
Hayden Faulkner,27 April 2020,1,Good initiative, and great app execution. The best government app I've used by far. Well developed, easy to use, very informative.,
Mike Lawson,26 April 2020,2,If you have a virtual private network enabled, you might have to turn it off to register. We did have to for one Samsung phone with Android v 10.,
Sue Stackhouse,28 April 2020,1,I have been asked to update my data, and asked to put in the pin number they have given me. I did that and it's saying invalid. So I am not sure what is going on. Please send me a new pin number to my mobile phone please,
Samantha Addison,27 April 2020,2,Useless. Don't bother. Could not recognise my phone number. Tried with and without the leading zero. My daughter had exactly the same problem. Too bad if you do actually want t o help.,
Annika Victoria,27 April 2020,1,If you're having the issue of it saying your number is invalid, try the following: turn off Wi-Fi (this worked for me), or reset the app (worked for my friend).,
James Bowering,26 April 2020,5,Ideally the app shouldn't have been available to download before the system went live as advertised at 6pm Sunday. Anyway, a great cause and something that I'm happy to support.,
Brendan Nech,27 April 2020,1,This app is such a great way to protect the vulnerable even if you're not that interested in coronavirus this is this is a perfect way to get us out of lock down and keep us out locked down the government can effectively contract Trace disobey excellent,
Ben W,28 April 2020,1,Just need to somehow make it available for users who's app store account isn't Australia because lots of foreign friends in Australia are reporting that it's not available for them.,
Julie Keast,26 April 2020,Its fine. Easy to register and as long as its used for the intended purpose then realy I don't see any issues.,
Jenni Casey,26 April 2020,5,Easy to install with only small hiccup. App kept on saying invalid phone number. Then I switched off my Wi-Fi to use mobile data and the app accepted my number immediately.,
Karen Henderson,27 April 2020,4,If enough people utilise this app, you can be assured of notification if you come into contact with a person who tests positive. It makes sense to me!,
Laraine Webb,27 April 2020,Downloaded the App when I put in my mobile number to register, it says it is invalid. I tried putting in the whole 10 digits after +61 and then left off the 0.,
Mark Northcott,27 April 2020,21,Simple and easy to register (after the 6pm start). Moved to Samsung setting to exempt app from low battery settings. For the time they had to set up, well done.,
Steve Hogg,27 April 2020,Installed and opened app, filled in the requested info but it keeps telling me my mobile no. is invalid. So the app is a great idea.......... or would be, if it worked.,
Kevin Locust,29 April 2020,Strongly recommend eveyone to install the app for the best interest of our community. The easier and ealier we can control the pandemic, the sooner the restriction will be eased. Please support the app.,
Luke Jacobs,2 May 2020,Please show a count of how many contacts are logged within the app. That would then make this a tool that will let users identify if they are having a lot of contacts and better self manage.,
Jason Derby,4 May 2020,Works as intended. No battery drain, no interference with Bluetooth. Unobtrusive despite the constant notification banner.,
Mary T,2 May 2020,Works fine on S10. Took less than a minute to register and not alot of info asked for. Google knows way more about me.,
Pheak Chao,5 May 2020,I don't see why people complaining about to keep themself and other safe.. Only downloading woundnt cost you anything much.. People are concerning about their personal data , and don't don't see how they got a bunch of their data on social media apps, if government want their personal detail track t,
Ryan Webb-Johnson,6 May 2020,I can't believe people are whining about the notification being on all the time, the possibility of their battery being drained, about having to turn Bluetooth on and off etc. This app might help to save lives, including your own... that's a pretty fair trade for the minor inconvenience...,
Dennis B,6 May 2020,Would be good to have the status bar icon display when Bluetooth is off. Like the previous version did!! It was a v helpful reminder...,
Kess L,13 May 2020,Needs a way to be turned on and off easily - if im staying home for the day it doesnt need to be in the background. Otherwise works fine,
Claire Baylis,14 May 2020,1,Haven't touched it since I downloaded it but it drains my battery and messes with my Bluetooth whether I'm in my car or walking with wireless earphones. If it wasn't the reason I could go out, I'd delete it.,
Thomas Boulton,26 April 2020,12,Well I got to the third registration screen and it appears I don't have a valid phone number. A simple field value check should not be beyond the app. I am surprised that this got through testing.,
francis weir,27 April 2020,6,Unable to get my pin during setup (please try again later). Then it said my phone number was invalid. Now it's back to saying try again later. Update; finally let me register.,
Adrian Kosch,27 April 2020,A great way to get the country moving again. Most service providers and other apps collect infinitely more data.,
Shallan,28 April 2020,1,Very annoying that the icon keeps showing that it is running in the background. And banner, which i tried to remove. We dont need to constantly see this. Please remove.,
Dr David Randall,26 April 2020,1,If privacy is a concern, then as someone that spent 5 years writing secure finance apps and as someone that no longer installs social media apps and some Google apps, I have no reason not to install this app due to privacy concerns.,
Laurence Wade,27 April 2020,Encountered the problem with 'invalid phone number', solved by turning off Wi-Fi on my Android and trying again. It then worked,
Lloyd,26 April 2020,Seems pretty straight foward, needs bluetooth running all the time, small price to pay. **Pros outweigh the cons on this app.**,
David Anderson,28 April 2020,1,I keep my bluetooth running all day for this app, it has hardly affected my battery life. My phone still lasts the whole day.,
Wudderpudd,26 April 2020,Very easy to set up, and asks for very little info. Doesn't even need you to give your exact age, let alone birthday. It'll save lives but only if you and many others get the app.,
Tahereh Talebi,27 April 2020,1,App was great and installed and verified me very fast without any problems. I hope it helps to get live back to normal asap. Thanks,
Wal Trees,26 April 2020,11,No problems installing and signing up. For those having problem with the mobile number after the 61 do not put in the ZERO but put in all numbers from 4 and onwards (International format).,
Lee Meredith,28 April 2020,If you have trouble verifying your phone number, try turning off your wifi. Worked for me. Bizarre.,
Luke Murray,28 April 2020,Tryed multiple times to register , unfortunately my mobile number is apparently invalid . Yes i tried full number and dropping the zero. Please rectify this problem. Thanks,
Bill Bolton-Wade,19 May 2020,1,Plays havoc with Bluetooth devices. Headphones keep cutting out every 10 or twenty seconds. Uninstalled, restarted phone and everything works. Might reinstall later but this needs some work.,
Nigel Leivenzon,26 April 2020,58,Everyone should load this so we can get back to 'normal' as soon as possible. This only stores data locally until you get the virus and give consent to access your data.,
Matthew Martin,29 April 2020,Better than expected for something quick, would like to see source code. Satisfied with third party reports re personal data security.,
Peter Pan,29 April 2020,Installed and setup in minutes. Works well in the background. Hope more people will join in so that the government can lift the lockdown sooner.,
allen s,4 May 2020,Why does the app request location tracking? I have this disabled so I don't know if the app is working. It would be good to have this made clear.,
Ben W,2 May 2020,2,Bugs bugs bugs....Needed to upload data but there was never a verifiable code sent to me. Plus no button or link to get a resend. Dont download til they fix the app. Doesnt work.,
Ariel Wigdorowitz,1 May 2020,Fantastic app. If enough of us download it, the restrictions will be lifted and the economy will bounce back more quickly.,
miles,17 May 2020,6,It's a POS!!! won't stay on despite Bluetooth on & tracking app on in the background. , Yeh download the app they keep telling you, well fix it up and we will !!,
Robert Harding,9 May 2020,1,Have been running this since it became available. Not happy as my battery had been draining very quickly without me using my phone. Not hapoy time to uninstall,
Mick Wells,16 May 2020,Edit - Seems fixed in latest update. Causes my Sony Xperia Xa2 to blank screen during a call, making it impossible to hang up the call.,
Steele Alexander,15 May 2020,Invalid phone number with and without leading 0 so I can't sign up. Really poor not being able to progress past such a simple stage.,
A Google user,16 May 2020,1,Still waiting for my verification code after requesting it 5 times and tried all the help issues. I will not bother, I was sceptical before anyway.,
Jason Wismer,27 April 2020,Very easy to install and for me personally, the good of Australia outweighs any issues about my privacy.,
Augustin Deplante,27 April 2020,1,Easy to use, no bugs so far. For those saying it should geolocate instead of Bluetooth handshake: that would make it totally useless indoors,
Michael Eardley,26 April 2020,6,90 second download process, done 6.45pm Sunday 26 April. No issues at all. Now Barnaby Joyce + other right wing loonies, what are you up to that you don't want anyone else to know about? Oh apart from google/apple, facebook, Twitter and all those other apps you so hypocritically use while whinging a,
Nilhan Uduwarage,28 April 2020,4,Government keeps boasting about number of downloads. But the app has lot of flaws especially in registration process. I'm stuck in PIN stage, never receiving it.,
Daniel Buckley,26 April 2020,13,The COVID app was released early but you could only register after 7pm. Hence the bad reviews below. Seriously it's a good app, fast and easy to register. If we all download this app! The quicker Australia can come to normal again !,
Beatrice Lucas,27 April 2020,1,I'm trying to sign up, but when I enter my phone number +61 ... I receive the message "invalid number" even though the number I enter is correct.,
Peter Bright,27 April 2020,Works as expected, registration easy and doesn't require personal information aside from your name and postcode.,
Taio Darkstrider,27 April 2020,Simple and easy. Yes it keeps you're Bluetooth on but if you use wireless headphones or a smart watch you're basically doing that anyway,
A Google user,26 April 2020,2,For those having problems with their phone number, do NOT enter the first zero of your number. It is not required. Easy registration.,
Linda Britten,27 April 2020,No issues at all. Easy to jump on board... Other apps ask for much more information and require many more permissions. Let's get back to normal asap,
Andrew Lynes,27 April 2020,Installed as advertised. As advised, I waited until 6pm on 26/Apr before trying to register. Who knew that following instructions would have worked out so well?,
Julie Wilcox,26 April 2020,1,A great concept which allows the Health Dept to see who has been close to us without tracking our location so that we can get tested early if someone someone with Covid19 has been near for a period of time. Well done!,
Tamara Gregoric,27 April 2020,2,Keeps telling me my phone number is invalid. I have tried installing and reinstalling. Tried both with and without "0" first. I give up.,
Robert Byrne,26 April 2020,1,

Vasily Ivanov,14 May 2020,1,Really great app, I hope enough people install it, and it'll come in handy to keep Australia safe from the second wave of the virus.,
Simon Crooke,29 April 2020,18,Easy to set up and appears to be moderate on power consumption. Requires a leap of faith to trust the Government won't be Machiavellian or incompetent. On balance the risks are worth it for the public health benefit. Sign up and let's crush this virus. Several days of use shows that this app account,
Karl Wetzler,29 April 2020,2,I can't get past the first screen. There is a button that says 'I want to help' but no other options. I'm trying to find a skip option, but there is nothing. I'm not doing this because I 'want to'.,
Jo-anne bader,2 May 2020,2,This can't be installed on many Android devices. Yo gov! Not everyone in Australia has the latest iPhone or Samsung. I know multiple people who can't have this app.,
Roberto Nungaray,3 May 2020,Installed it the day it came out. Have had no issues. SEEMS to be working fine on the background.,
Matthew Reid,1 May 2020,1,Seems to function in the background so long as I keep my Bluetooth turned on with the only intrusiveness being a persistent notification bar icon.,
Kady Schottler,14 May 2020,This app is a major drain on phone battery and is very disruptive to Bluetooth headphones (cutting connection 2-5 times each track).,
Jin Oz,15 May 2020,The installation and registration process was easy. Running the app is a small contribution to having the pandemic under control.,
Jevarah Lunam,20 May 2020,1,Doesn't even work, as of 20/05 officials aren't even able to use the data. Almost a month after its release.,
Michael Nicholson,20 May 2020,2,Unable to get past putting my ph number in as it says it's invalid. Update, I didn't realise you need to remove the 0 from in front of my number. Maybe they should mention this in the setting up instructions,
Ganquan Chen,26 April 2020,1,It is hard to remember all the contacts. Even, I don't even know the contact details of some people that I have been close to. This app helps a lot.,
Bijesh Balakrishnan,30 April 2020,3,All good but it keeps interfering with my other Bluetooth devices (headphones and speakers). I frequently loose connection to them.,
Damon Opacak,26 April 2020,6,For all those that complain about not being to sign up, although the app doesn't mention it, ABC News mentions you'll be able to sign up with mobile number after 18:00AEST,
Gideon Whibble,7 May 2020,Easy to install. No invasive questions. Edit: Have used since release with no bluetooth or battery issues. The single icon in the status bar is clutter but not annoying.,
Marther A,27 April 2020,2,My mother and her friends are elderly. They have old phones because they are used to them. They cannot get new phones because they would have trouble learning the new technology. This app doesn't work on their old phones. They are in the most vulnerable age bracket to die of the virus. The governmen,
Karen Wilkinson,27 April 2020,3,For those of us having the invalid phone number problem, the trick is to turn your wifi off and then it will send you the pin code.,
Bob Hickson,28 April 2020,The app continually says invalid phone number. Have tried with both Bluetooth and WiFi on, off and combined, also deleting the zero from phone number. The phone has Android 7.,
Joe Lewis,27 April 2020,2,Making Battery Optimisation a mandatory permission means I can't use this app. If I don't have my phone on at least Medium power saving, I can't get my job done. Fail.,
Ess Grubb,26 April 2020,4,Easy to install and complete. No issues. For those struggling with invalid numbers remember to drop the 0 at the begining of your number as it has the +61 prefix,
John Austin,27 April 2020,Installed easily, to those that give 1 star because they are stuck somewhere please read the instructions and use a little intelligence.,
Robert Macpherson,27 April 2020,2,Hopeless. The pin code showed momentarily. I entered it on the phone and pressed verify. Nothing happened. Have tried numerous times. 1 star is too generous.,
Simon Merrifield,28 April 2020,Won't accept my phone number, says number is invalid. Not sure why. Will try again at a later date. Does the app need an update for this as i see a few reviews with the same issue,
Rob Harvey,27 April 2020,App says my phone number is invalid. I typed it in 5 or 6 times, got someone to confirm it was right, tried it with and without the leading 0, it still reported my number as invalid.,
Peter M J Conrad,28 April 2020,Invalid phone number? Entered minus the 0 & with the 0 several times. Double & triple-checked my number with same result. Hit a road block so unable to activate.,
ben brown,26 April 2020,This app is vital to our country opening sooner rather than later. I have no concern about data security issues, as smart phones already track far more data than this app,
Ellen Hazelton,27 April 2020,No problems with installation after 6pm 26/ 4 when it was fully available . Happy to be part of the necessary 40% to help with managing the pandemic in Australia.,
Rohan Herring,27 April 2020,1,Tried registering numerous times and everytime I enter my mobile number it comes up with invalid mobile number?? How am I meant to join and help out when this app doesn't work properly??,

Gehan Somanader,2 May 2020,Every time I check in the morning the app is turned off. It only works if it's running in the background but it gets turned off by the OS,
Ant L,5 May 2020,10pc battery drain on a Google Pixel 2xl per hour, while at home.. Having this app on my phone over the next 12-18m required for a vaccine to be discovered also means charging this phone 2-4x instead of the usual 1-2x per day. This will severely impact the expected life of my phone and also, my usag,
Ross Cameron,13 May 2020,App does not start after turning phone off for several hours. I have to go into the app to restart it. I don't always remember to do it.,
John Wright,15 May 2020,My wife has a 2year old phone that is a system5 she cannot download the app very disappointing why wasn't this looked at before creating this app how many more are out there that cannot down load the app,
Michael Pemberton,26 April 2020,10,The app forces the IR LED used by the iris scanner on my phone to be always on. This drains the battery and produces enough background IR light to jam the IR signal from my TV remote.,
Chris,27 April 2020,1,Seems to be working well. If you rated this app badly because you tried to register before its release, you deserve a medal.,
Ashley Moore,26 April 2020,8,Pretty smooth running so far. Google Play, the platform I downloaded the app from, already has more of my information than the government will through this app so I thought I might as well give it a go.,
Jonathan Hill,26 April 2020,4,Unfortunately the phone number (which mine has been filled in correctly) Does not work , I've restarted the app however the initial set up with contact details is fine until you get your number to enter. I'm using a Pixel4XL,
Tom Meumann,27 April 2020,Simple and straightforward to use. Gives you a rundown of what it will do with your data before you sign up. Good work!,
Christopher Chin,27 April 2020,2,Great initiative and good use of technology. The privacy concerns of AWS are ridiculous when our bank data is shared every day and no one bats an eyelid! Well designed app.,
David Valentine,27 April 2020,3,Can't sign up. It's rejecting my mobile number with or without the leading zero. Fixed it by turning off WiFi and trying again,
Tan R,28 April 2020,Is anyone else getting a "Please try again later" message when trying to enter mobile number? Has been the same message for about 12 hours.,
Ozan K√º√ß√ºkbƒ±√ßak,26 April 2020,5,The App is legit and working. Low rating is because of some people trying to activate the app before the government's announced take off time. Download it now to keep track of possibly contacting infected people!,
Colin Bakon,26 April 2020,Downloaded and installed without any problems and then registered without any issues. This will help us bust this virus. Download it and use it.,
The Cobra Ward,28 April 2020,In the first 24 hours have had to restart my phone 3 times ad the internet stops working. Hopefully this is a bug that can be fixed?,
Tim McArdle,26 April 2020,2,Neat and clean app. Set and forget. Everyone should install this, there is no reason not to. Could do without the permanent notification that needs to remain active.,
Colin McKay,27 April 2020,1,A good use of technology to help reduce the spread of this disease. Leaving bluetooth on sure drains the battery though.,
Joshua Niland,26 April 2020,8,Ignore the low score naysayers. This app was easy to setup and is a fantastic utility to help slow the spread of Covid19. Installed for the whole family.,
Sarah Chaplin,27 April 2020,1,Just need to turn WiFi off to register your phone number. BTW Google knows more about vwhat you do via location services, smurfs and tracking than the Australian Government will learn from this app.,
Garry Dukes,26 April 2020,6,Cant get code to open . . . told me my mobile phone number was "invalid" (# entered with and without the first zero) If registrations are overloaded why doesn't it just honestly say that instead of saying your # is invalid! Very poor IMO!,
Ruairi Hardy,26 April 2020,2,For those getting "invalid number" issues, just drop the 0 at the start of your number as it uses the international calling code,
Phil Newman,27 April 2020,I tried to help, seriously, but each time I added my mobile number it said it was an invalid number, went back and tried half a dozen times, even tried dropping the 0.,
Christine Burnett,27 April 2020,Terrible. I put in my mobile number in several times and it kept informing me Invalid number. Frustrating. Have tried many times same result. What else can I do.????,
Kit Marshall,27 April 2020,1,The app won't accept Norfolk Island mobile numbers. Norfolk is part of Australia and should be able to use the app as well.,

Cheryl Stevenson,2 May 2020,I believe in this app 100% but annoyingly it stops Spotify every time it scans. Is there a way to turn off scanning if you're staying home and not leaving the house?,
Marilyn Roach,3 May 2020,Works perfectly fine for me. Running in the background, haven't noticed an impact on battery,
Kourt QueenBee,3 May 2020,Everyone needs to install this app otherwise it won't detect if someone's been in contact with you that is diagnosed with covid-19. Genius app!! üëç,
steven parker,5 May 2020,1,App is fine except that it uses bluetooth which I have off all the time normally. All good if it helps prevent even one granny from getting really crook.,
Abhi Verma,6 May 2020,3,The latest version is closing itself every 10 mins. The 0.11 version was stable.,
Jaye Parks,6 May 2020,2,The app is constantly accessing proximity sensor, it's flashing all the time. This app shouldn't need to endlessly activate that sensor,
Geoff Jones,6 May 2020,1,A great idea, but it keeps interfering with my Bluetooth headphone connection, making it drop out regularly :(,
Paul Mcpherson,12 May 2020,2,Bluetooth issues on android device, have found that the app is causing my Bluetooth to drop in and out for a split second at a time, very annoying.,
Stan Karasinski,16 May 2020,App switches itself off! Need to continually monitor the optimisation battery section and switch on for it to function!!!!,
M Bryant,27 April 2020,1,straight forward registration didn't ask exact age , only a post code & bluetooth connection ... good on aus Gov for coming up with such a great idea üòä,
Paul Williams,27 April 2020,1,Just a quick update if possible. That it can detect when home and auto Bluetooth off when there? Save battery.,
Colin Pilkington,28 April 2020,Installation steps lacked help when invalid number occurred. Needed to search for a solution after many unsuccessful tries. Turns out that WiFi needed to be off.,
MeYelling,27 April 2020,1,3 times it closed and I had to redo my details First try I never got my pin to enter and now it doesn't recognize my phone number. We were guaranteed this would not happen.,
Josef Ravenscroft,9 May 2020,2,Essential! Only problem seems to be with Apple phones and running in the background.. Can't really think how the app could be improved otherwise!,
Lyn Hingston,27 April 2020,2,It says my mobile no. is invalid. It also says my husband's mobile no. is invalid as well. How many others are experiencing the same problem.,
Stephanie Topfer,26 April 2020,14,There is nothing wrong with the app. The negative reviews are from people who didn't read that registrations only opened from a certain time. They have now been opened and it works perfectly fine.,
Jose Carvalho,26 April 2020,App is up and running smoothly, registration took less than a minute.,
Phillip Martin,28 April 2020,The app does not accept my phone number regardless of format. Have tried uninstalling and reinstall to no avail. The is no "help" link so I could get this sorted.,
Ren√©e Sz√©cs√©nyi,27 April 2020,Love the idea and want to help but would be great if I could switch it off while at home to save battery and not have a notification sitting there all the time.,
Philip Fowdar,27 April 2020,4,Easy registration process. The app has been cleared from a privacy perspective but you can even enter fictitious personal information for those who are paranoid. Everyone please download and support this initiative so we can all get back to normality faster and reopen the economy whilst keeping ever,
Ross Goldfinch,26 April 2020,Very easy to install, does better than commercial apps in protecting privacy, especially as it will probably save lives,
sue mcarthur,27 April 2020,Can't add phone number. I want the app but it needs to iron out some bugs. Early days,
William Butcher,27 April 2020,Simple to set up! Uses pretty much zero battery, and about 60kb of data every 12 hours. 66mb of RAM used. Very happy!,
cha w,27 April 2020,3,Great idea. I'd hope anyone with concerns is unable to read this as they shouldn't be online at all. If they are then they should make themself useful to their fellow Australians and get this app so we can get out of iso sooner.,
Steve Danielsen,27 April 2020,1,I'm sure the app is great and I know it's working in the back ground, but surely you can remove the constant notification on the screen and in the notification drop down. Please remove this feature,
Local Coaster,27 April 2020,1,App still wants to stay on when your at home . Why ? Can you install an option to switch it off when you get home nobody wants their bluetooth to stay on wasting your battery power for nothing . I uninstalled it die to this annoying factor please fix.,

Gregory Rice,16 May 2020,It seems as though my battery runs flat quicker than usual since installing, and my screen is always warm.,
John Caimotto,27 April 2020,1,If you switch on airplane mode it will turn off Bluetooth. You need to manually turn on Bluetooth. Stay safe Australia.,

Russell Stewart,26 April 2020,1,Easy to install. I think a lot of people are problems because they are entering the leading zero. Not necessary when you see +61. :),
Winston MacCracken,27 April 2020,Easy to install. Shame app has to be left open to work, many users will likely close it unintentionally on Android devices when clearing apps.,
Nicole Masson,26 April 2020,1,Easy and quick to install. Great initiative, I hope many will get on board and download it. This could save lives! Thank you.,
Isreal Mathew,28 April 2020,2,I've read through everything and am satisfied that they've done everything to mitigate our concerns. The pseudonyms, basic demographics, two hour ID's, 21 day retention, explicit approval/action to access data and legal/criminal consequences if it is used for any other purpose. I'm actually impresse,

mgr bkk,30 April 2020,1,As a user I would want to know if someone who tests positive has sneezed near me. This takes less than 10 seconds. Not sure why the digital handshake is set at 15 minutes. I would rather it be 2 minutes or less,

andy cunningham,4 May 2020,Someone will allow a random Facebook app access to all their account data to do a quiz on "what colour toast are you" but they won't download an app that helps the government fight covid19. This app is a great step in the right direction to helping us get back to normal,
val enright,4 May 2020,I tried to enter the pin sent to me, but it was rejected. I was sent another pin and it too was rejected! Why not make this thing a bit easier! I have tried repeatedly but I'm ready to give up. One more try. 11:55pm!,
Namal Kulathunga,14 May 2020,So far so good. Havent had any issues. Was expecting to drain the battery. But even this is not noticeable. So why not help the community to get out of this pandemic..,

Darren Austin,27 April 2020,1,Super easy to sign up. I love that we have the technology to automate contact tracing.,

Rebecca Campbell,11 May 2020,2,Easy install and sign up but it is ruining my connection with other Bluetooth devices that I need to use.,

Chris Australian Art For Sale,10 May 2020,2,App closes every time the screen locks and I have to restart the phone over and over. If this is to work it needs to be reliable.,
Hamish Cross,30 April 2020,2,people who hate the government are saying this is a good idea, you have an independent code review who decompiled the app and said it is safe, and you have a chance to make your life, and those around you safer, you have to put aside your fears. If ur worried about data loss, do some research about,
Vera Metallum,2 May 2020,App itself is alright but ever since I installed it, other apps are randomly shutting down and generally malfunctioning.,

Rob Van Dongen,27 April 2020,1,I haven't been tested yet for "Beer" virus. BUT Worked on wife's phone, but apparently my phone is invalid. Now considering I've had it for more than 2 years, I believe this could be another F@!4- up by our government.,
Simon Delaney,26 April 2020,4,Super easy to install and register. The early 1 star reviews were due to the app not being live but it's all working now.,
garry greenhill,26 April 2020,2,Took a while to get registered probably because I tried it before 6. However all up & running now, only to willing participate can't understand all the naysayers.

Greg Matthews,27 April 2020,18,What happened to the 6pm registration time? 8.15pm still getting the invalid phone number message. How many people will now not sign up after 20 plus attempts? UPDATE 27/4/2020 try to enter you number and send without Wi-Fi on allowed mine to connect straight away.,
brian g,29 April 2020,1,Entering the pin number for some is not easy. Had to help some as you have to go to messages to get pin so app closes. Catch 22,
Gia Kelly,30 April 2020,This is important and if you are hesitating, know that it isn't tracking your movements... Also that it is going to give you an early warning if you've been in contact with an infected person so you can isolate and get tested and keep your family and community safe.,

Prism Presley,4 May 2020,2,Asks for location information, hasn't released source code, data is held by Amazon, won't work on older phones and requires Bluetooth constantly (opening a back-door to your phone). Typical government funded project.,

Raj Poonia,27 April 2020,The app is not accepting my correct mobile number which i have since 2006. Unable to proceed further in installation.,

A Google user,27 April 2020,Apparently my phone number I've had for over 8 years is invalid. Tried 14 times, couldnt recieve a pin therefore couldnt register. Deleted app.,
Marg Williams,26 April 2020,12,I have installed but it needs access to location services. As I understand it this should not be necessary!!! Probably won't use it now.,
Lincoln Ramsay,26 April 2020,1,Quick and simple to setup. No nasty permissions. Do your bit to help us ease restrictions.,
David Radnell,27 April 2020,1,I am happy to download the app if it helps keep the virus in check and allows the government to relax restrictions.,
A Google user,27 April 2020,1,Make sure your Wi-Fi is turned off to register. I installed and uninstalled twice and it wouldn't recognise my phone number until I turned wifi off.,

Peta Osborne,28 April 2020,It would not work even after turning off Wi-Fi so I switched off my phone and restarted it. THEN it worked!,
Peter James,26 April 2020,Easy to register. Pleased to be doing what I can to get beyond this pandemic asap. Great app to assist this goal,

Grant Doran,29 April 2020,1,Easy install and configure. Doesn't seem to chew through as much power as I thought it would.,
Lucinda Hossack,30 April 2020,1,It's a clever app but if you put a thing in where you don't need blue tooth on when at home to save power,
Peter Bon,3 May 2020,When you get to point of entering PIN that is sent via phone it locks up and install will not complete. Tried reinstalling, using 4g only still no go.,
PIN-WEI TU,4 May 2020,I wanted to help but i failed registration. It keeps showing my mobile is an "invalid number" and of course i have tried both without putting the first number 0 or with 0 but all have been denied?,
Justin Foley,5 May 2020,1,Everytime the app handshakes with another blue tooth my Bluetooth headphones drop out. Not world ending but annoying particularly if I am on a phone call.,
Nathan Locke,8 May 2020,Works fine I guess, just wish I ould turn off the app while I'm at home. No need for it to be running 24/7 if I'm in my own home.,
frank saunders,13 May 2020,For oppo Reno z users turn battery selection to running background from app management don't use the opposion from covid permission screen I have oppo and had the same issue as Jon Smith,
Craig Ringer,13 May 2020,1,The update description is "bug fixes". Seriously. Changelog link or release notes please? You're expecting trust here. Show some. You also continue to violate open source licenses and fail to release source. I reluctantly installed this in the hope you could do better. Show me you can.,
Araluen Ekala,15 May 2020,Battery optimisation option constantly flagging every time the app opens regardless of how many times I select allow.,
Cameron Krook,26 April 2020,4,PIN not received (twice) within 5-minute time out, and resend PIN link doesn't work. Hard to understand how such a simple but important app can be faulty on release.,

Brett Reilly,26 April 2020,1,So easy to register if you have an IQ above 0. If +61 precedes the mobile number you drop the first 0. Great initiative brilliant idea!,
David Mathieson,1 May 2020,2,Reinstall a few days later worked, but why is it needing location approval. It's a contact information not a location information app.,
Clara Crompton,27 April 2020,1,Apart from the hiccup with initially not being able to register all is good now. Doesn't seem too heavy on battery usage either.,
John Paget,26 April 2020,Easy to install. If everyone was to do this I would feel a lot safer. Bluetooth runs all the time on my phone to connect with my car. Do not see any more battery use than normal . Sign up everyone and let's get this country out of quarantine,

John Rouse,28 April 2020,The app does not recognize my mobile number. Update. Finally managed to have it recognize my phone number.,

Michelle Kenworthy,27 April 2020,1,Great app. Easy to install. Register. Let's hope I never get a phone call!,
Mohd Hussain,26 April 2020,15,Good initiative. We might not know whether we got in close contact with a COVID patient until some one informs us or when we start showing symptoms. I would definitely recommend the app installed on our phone to save our lives as well as others.,
Olivia H,29 April 2020,When out and about in certain areas it fails to run e.g undercover car parks in shopping centres when getting groceries and other necessaries. Please fix,
Sze Yen Tan,30 April 2020,1,It says this app doesn't collect location info but it requires you to enable your location service on the phone. Not sure why.,
Ian Caughley,1 May 2020,1,This kind of contact tracing is a great idea, and my research indicates next to no privacy issues.,
jo by,4 May 2020,1,Samsung S5 Gt-19507 smart mobile phone cannot download this app. Must be millions of Australians with the similar issues.,

Stephen Engwicht,27 April 2020,Easy install and registration. Minimal personal information required.,

Stephen Thornton,27 April 2020,Unable to register despite several attempts. Why should I have to keep on trying.,
Ross Graham,28 April 2020,Tried to download... couldn't get past the phone number... even though I put in the correct number it kept coming up invalid number...,
Brendan Gooden,26 April 2020,38,Good initiative, everyone needs to get on board and download the app so we can relax the lockdown measures. Those concerned about privacy likely have other apps on their phone that collect more data than this app (think Apple, Google maps etc),
Claire West,26 April 2020,1,Not sure why available before you can register..however that doesn't make it worth a 1 star review... giving it 5 stars as will save lives. Available after 6pm to register. Just wait everyone....,
Justin L.,26 April 2020,Seems to work well, signup was straightforward and phone number verification worked.,
Glen McDonald,28 April 2020,3,Causing major issues with Bluetooth connectivity to other devices. Also a massive battery drainer.,

I will continue to review and provide feedback moving forward. Feedback for the developers: Re signup. Not everyone in the community will und,
Daniel Gooding,28 April 2020,2,App opens and registered no problem. There is interference with using Bluetooth speakers intermittently which only started after installing this app,
Kate Heathcote,27 April 2020,1,If your getting invalid phone number switch off your wifi and Bluetooth on your mobile and try again.,
Brendan Hawken,26 April 2020,46,Right idea, wrong execution. It will notify if there is "Close contact" - within 1.5m for 15 minutes. What about workers dealing with customers, interactions of less than 15minutes but still a strong chance of transmission. Can't see how such a lenient rule will help anyone detect their exposure to,
Dennis Creighton,26 April 2020,Great concept. So far it works as expected, no problems.,

Finlay Semmens,4 May 2020,A good theory, but in practice was far less than perfect.

James Grigg,5 May 2020,1,Testing of this APP shows flaws. It will respond with "invalid phone number" if for whatever reason you need to register again.

It creates trust in an environment where a lot of people feel there is potential for miss use of data.,
Danny Koreny,26 April 2020,15,Where's the source code? Touting security as a reason not to release it, is security by obscurity, this is not good practice. I want to be able to stand by this app; I've already had others ask me if it's "safe". Please, release the source; you will get more uptake, and free peer review.,
James Holmes,26 April 2020,1,Took less than a minute to setup. We all need to get on board to keep our community safe.,
Linda Bell,2 May 2020,1,Installed fine. Interferes with my other Bluetooth use though. I regularly use phone with Bluetooth speakers or earphones and it constantly makes them cut out. Uninstalled and everything working fine again . Need the option to turn app off when home or make it work without interfering with regular b,
Fiona Ryder,29 April 2020,EDITED After downloading this app I could no longer access a number of other apps, including for banking and papers. Had to uninstall. Happy to reinstall if this is fixed. Gave 3 stars as I think this is a good initiative but I can't have it installed due to these other issues. Suspect the issues ar,
Amro Amputch,1 May 2020,When I downloaded this app over the 3 days I noticed my Wi-Fi speed on the phone was 50% less then normal. At the same time all my tablet with Bluetooth device was affected. Including my work laptop. When i uninstalled it my Wi-Fi and all device internet speed was back to normal as in not 50% less.,
San Jag,11 May 2020,1,Bluetooth connection goes crazy with this App installed on my Samsung Note 9. When I try to connect my phone to any of my other Bluetooth devices like my external Bluetooth speaker, then the phone gets into a continuous loop of scanning for Bluetooth devices, connecting and disconnecting. I uninstal,
William Laurent,27 April 2020,Pointless. Can only track people when the contamination has been done and does not help to prevent by checking daily the users on potential symptoms to send teams for proper testing.

G Alexander,26 April 2020,Very straight forward,
Paul Tinson,26 April 2020,3,Stupid app, you need to leave the app to see the pin sent but when you go back in the app starts from the beginning and you are sent a new pin. I was going to use but now deleted. Typical Gov initiative all noise no substance. This has nothing to do with the earlier problem of not being able to regi,
J Google User,26 April 2020,Very easy on my third attempt... For all those stupid 1 star guys and girls - why not show some patience - no-one is saying you must have it up and running by 10pm tonight.

Arnaud Gay,4 May 2020,1,I don't mind using this app, I'm actually quite happy to help. But I constantly have issues with my other Bluetooth devices...

John Carone,17 May 2020,Useless app, my android phone is only 2 years old but still as soon as screen goes off the app deactivates and shuts down. Fix asap or will uninstall it's not working anyway. Typical government can't get a bloody app right that works for everyone. And they want you to download app, what a joke!!!!!,
Jon Nation,26 April 2020,16,Tried it. Deemed a fail already because Bluetooth needs to be on ALL THE TIME when you're out, and thus running the battery down faster. No one will want to leave Bluetooth on all the time time, aside from the security implications of leaving Bluetooth on all the time, the battery waste is laughable,
Michael Andrews,26 April 2020,5,The app keeps trying to connect to my laptop via bluetooth because it is within 1.5m. The notifications drove me crazy after 10 minutes - the app tried to connect about 20 times and I couldn't accept or block the attempts. This needs to be fixed ASAP. Other than that download and install was easy.,
Mark Cornall,27 April 2020,1,Can't even register,
The Barefoot Renovator,28 April 2020,1,All was going okay till I got into the car and found out that the phone would no longer connect via Bluetooth to the car. It appears that this app takes priority in the Bluetooth selection. The only way to get Bluetooth back for the car was to uninstall this app and restart the phone. I'm using Andr,

Bridget S,2 May 2020,Unfortunately I had to uninstall this app as it kept interfering with my bluetooth headphones and speaker. They both kept dropping out, every time I would use them. As soon as I uninstalled the app it stopped happening. Very disappointing as I think the app is a great idea (Galaxy S9+),

Bob Street,27 April 2020,Privacy not much of a problem if you're dead...... OK by me.,
Chris Burns,3 May 2020,Good idea but need to do something about the battery life it just kills your phone. I have a galaxy s10 3 months old and since I put this app on the battery life has diminished substantially. If your a business person and use your phone for work this just wouldn't be practical as your phone would go,
TIM Quick,9 May 2020,1,Download and set up OK. Decreased my daily battery life by almost 4 hours, uninstaller and all good! Also, tried to install on my wife's phone and no matter what we tried it kept saying "invalid phone number", did everything advised, still the same. Make it work properly and I'll put it back on!!,
Thushari Perera,26 April 2020,1,Instead of criticizing each little or great effort authorities make to keep folks safe, be proactive, use the app and do your bit for Covid 19,
Fineran Family,26 April 2020,I have no issue installing the app but it should work. Releasing an app that is 'vital' to stop the spread should allow people to register. Poor form & let us wait to hear the excuses. Not being able to do the basics is unacceptable. This is not feeling entitled; I want to help like most people but,
andrew andrew,26 April 2020,1,Easy and safe,
Kieran Kemp,28 April 2020,1,This app is the best thing i have ever seen. It supports most devices. it doesn't install on my device. that's why i love it so much, it's so trash i love it. You thing it would be compatible with all devices, but that's why your wrong.I have a Samsung yet the app isn't compatible with my phone. As,
Leonard Frankel,28 April 2020,2,Yes, my phone number is valid, but I can't get past that screen. If they can screw that up, what else is wrong in there? Why was this released before it passed internal review? Why has the full source code not been made public, for independent peer review? But what else can you expect after the sham,
Matt Glover,26 April 2020,BUG: On a Samsung S8, if you install the app all the way through to being active, then uninstall it, then reinstall it, it fails on the screen where you enter your phone number. It continually says "invalid phone number". At at this stage I cannot reactivate the APP on my phone.,
Anne Miller,27 April 2020,2,It's probably great but my poor old Android's battery can't handle the strain from running Bluetooth and keeps on switching it off. And, yes, I've checked all the phone settings. Sorry Federal Government. I can't help. Now uninstalled.,
stuart durkin,1 May 2020,3,I think the Australian government is doing a fantastic job in the control of and response to covid-19. In this app we see the first real fail.

Peter Holman,4 May 2020,Easy and safe,
David Aked,28 April 2020,3,It's an important app. But is only useful if your phone doesn't run out of battery. I normally finish the day on 65%. I've had to plug by phone in to charge during the day. I'm now at 12% after a 25% top up charge. This thing eats batteries for breakfast. Uninstalling.,
Dawn Spencer,26 April 2020,1,Does not accept phone number,
George Badawy,26 April 2020,1,Easy to install and activated. Privacy is not an issue as already hundreds of apps including Google tracking us aggressively. This is a good idea to make sure we can minimise the risk of the spread of the virus. I encourage people to install it.,
f sesel,28 April 2020,2,Pointless waste of time installing - it won't let me register to use it as it keeps telling me my (perfectly as valid) phone number is invalid. And yes, I tried multiple times (and my partner had exactly the same problem on his iPhone).,
Hannah Rowbottom,4 May 2020,This app caused a lot of issues with my phone. Other apps started to freeze and there was a delay in opening things. I've now uninstalled this app and my phone is back to normal. Selfishly, I won't be downloading it again until fixed.,

si myob,30 April 2020,1,Does not drain my battery,
Andrew Franklin,3 May 2020,Apparently the App is not operational yet a week after its launch. If it only registers contacts when less than 1.5m away for more than 15 minutes its pointless, how many people are you going to be in that close contact with unless you take public transport or sit in a car or eat at a restaurant,
Tyler,3 May 2020,1,Doesn't stay running in the background. After a couple of minutes, it just closes. I'm not going to keep restarting my phone or the app to keep it running. Very much the same issue as Amy below, with it constantly needing acceptance of the battery optimisation.,
Antony Lewis,5 May 2020,Very disappointed in app and have uninstalled. Could not turn off the alert or have this as a choice. Never use or used bluetooth and is a very annoying function that keeps want to link to devices. Federal government has not provided follow up detail on how it works for privacy/security,
Brad Buhse,8 May 2020,2,Uses significant amount of battery. Also very annoying when listening to music constant dropping out as a result of this app. Had no issues like this prior to having this app. Uninstalled the app and issue fixed. Fix the problem and I might re install it.,
Kestrel Orr,15 May 2020,Once I installed it affected the way all my other phone apps run. I had to uninstall to get my Bluetooth with the car working properly again all though I still have issues, suddenly all my banking apps are no longer working.

Johannes Groenewald,6 May 2020,As soon as I installed it my Bluetooth crapped out, so my calls brake up and it sounds like I am talking under water when I am connected to my car. I spend most my day on the road. Uninstalled it and everything was back to normal.,
Ben Stevenson,6 May 2020,2,Criteria used by app for determining spread of virus is pointless. More likely to catch from the person in restaurant kitchen making your meal or someone sneezing on handle of supermarket trolley.

Laura C,30 April 2020,Good initiative to keep everyone safe. But two complaints since downloading: 1) Drains battery exponentially and 2) Disconnects my headphones. Both of which a huge nuisance.

Dominic Mtakula,27 April 2020,We need every tool available to stop the spread of coronovirus so that our lives can return to some normalcy again. This is a great way to achieve this.

Steven Lawrence,26 April 2020,1,All working correctly now 6pm has passed,
Bob L,26 April 2020,4,I get out infrequently, so the preferred operation is that I run it when I leave the house. Right now I can't do that - the app won't shut down, wants to run all the time and nags about bluetooth. Please provide a version which permits me to run it my way.,
J,26 April 2020,Using this app could save someone's life. Jump in!,
Donzen Towny,30 April 2020,1,The app was easy enough to install and doesn't seem to have an adverse effect on battery life. However i cannot connect to my car media center for hands free, maps etc. Once i removed the app , i could once again connect my phone to my car.,
Ken Lawrence,2 May 2020,1,I have tried to download the app for 3 nights and waited up to an hour for the download to start. I have given up trying and if most people experience the same trouble, then the government is not going to get the numbers required.,
Mercifulmerc,2 May 2020,I was looking for something with radius circles indicating spread zones on a map. This is something basic and should have quite franktly been at the forefront of idea's for this application. However it does not exist.,
T Northam,13 May 2020,Get rid of the notification saying it's running that you cant clear from your screen. Annoying, the app should be a download and forget. Additionally it's a bit amateurish to have a " :) " emoji at the end of the notification. I have deleted app and am not the only one.,

Aleksandra Gaj,28 April 2020,I was able to register fine but my phone keeps crushing if I actually keep the app going. At first I thought the phone broke but as soon as I switch the bluetooth off it works well again. I'm very disappointed as I was looking forward to having this app.,

Finley Janjic,27 April 2020,1,The 15+ minute rule is dumb and will make the app less effective. It doesnt take 15 minutes for someone to sneeze or cough or even just exhale and for those particles to enter my nose or mouth if I'm within 1.5 meters...itll take seconds.
